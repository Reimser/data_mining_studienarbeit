Imo trying to ID Satoshi is kind of a dick move. Here's this guy that gave us Bitcoin and benevolently stepped away from both wealth and authority. He went to great lengths to protect his identity and remain pseudonymous. And here's a bunch of dipshits who want to ruin that just to be the guy who discovered who Satoshi was.

medbhmt,"It's pretty funny to see how this sub changes cycle to cycle.  In the last one, it was ""never tell anyone how much bitcoin you have"", because it'd make you a target for scams and hacking.  Now that BTC is worth twice as much in fiat bucks, the mentality here seems to be ""announce how much bitcoin you have to everyone!""

Then again, in the last cycle people were against centralization and banks/governments/wall street controlling large amounts of bitcoin, and the idea of giving custody of your coins to anyone else was considered ridiculous.  Now everyone is cheering for state and federal reserves, a single company owning over 1% of all coins, ETFs where you can never withdraw actual BTC, and banks offering to custody your coins.

Ethereum is a lot like using a freeway in LA. It’s repulsive and the HOV lane costs a paycheck to use, but it’s all we have to use. 

Thing is, MANY other blockchains have now bypassed Ethereum altogether and they’re just as secure, if not more. Proof of stake isn’t anything new but Jesus it’s archaic compared to so many other options.

How much was sold?
The sales totaled $2.6 billion.

FTX sold 30 million of its locked-up SOL tokens at a price of $64 each.

It’s hard to stay positive when my president is a shitcoiner. I have a dream where launching coins and tokens is an *expensive* undertaking. I am sick of dime a dozen shitcoins.

Seeing scumbags launch coin after coin, watching desperate idiots fall for it again, and again, and again has caused me to see crypto as nothing more than a way to swindle the masses.

Now, whether he will be able to achieve any of this is up in the air. His ""mandate"" isn't what many people think.  Hopefully I don't need to explain why. The good news, for Democrats, is the house is likely going to come down to 1 or 2 Republicans needing to vote against their party in order to kill a bill.  


Now on the point of unrest, Elon has already stated it's in the plans for Americans to go through being uncomfortable for a period of time ""for the long-term good and stability"". That is easy to say coming from billionaires who are in a position to line their personal pockets (Tesla, space-x, neuralink, x) being in positions of power over policy that will affect said companies.

Not sure what you mean by 'reassessing you spending at the end of every quarter' though? Don't you already know this is roughly $13.5k every quarter? 

You've got the foundation under control - just set it and forget it.

I'd recommend taking the class of '17 approach - altcoins are here to make more btc.   
Maybe incorporate that into your DCA strategy (DCA $100 into BTC, and $25 in the other two).

Everything goes to zero against BTC in the long run. 

After a while, micromanage your gains from one stack to another.

Also, get off robinhood. Get on a real exchange. You're shooting yourself in the foot (with a BB gun) 3x a day every day in the same place. Put your BTC on a flash drive too... The other two you can leave on an EXCHANGE. Get off robinhood, they're a broker (middleman to you and the exchanges).",1
