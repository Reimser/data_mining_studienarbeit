When the price goes up they post stories of lost crypto, when the price goes down, they will broadcast the total trading losses across the planet.

It‚Äôs possible to generate the checksum bits off-line, my question was **how**. My question you did not address in your comment. I had a feeling there were ways to do it with hardware wallets for example so the link that bitusher supplied above is extremely helpful. From my experience, it was not easy to figure out as I originally saw to simply download the program to run the hash, then take my computer off-line and run the string of bits in the hash to find the bits needed. For example, 10 years ago in the paper wallet era. It was easy to download a Wallet‚Äã generator and then take your computer off-line and run it to create public/private key pairs. But I did not find any such sha256 program that I could simply download and run, hence my question. I thought maybe other people had the same experience I did, so I thought it would be a good idea to present the question so that someone could provide links showing *how* to do it.",1
