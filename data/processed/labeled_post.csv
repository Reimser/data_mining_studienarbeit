I only earn a small amount from apps every month so I'm very casual at the moment but I'm becoming more interested lately and plan to eventually start setting extra money aside and buying. I've only made one small purchase using Trust wallet and everything went fine but some of the reviews I've seen are conflicting. I was wondering if there's a better free wallet I could use or if Trust wallet is fine? Also, what's the process like transferring BTC from one wallet to another?",1

1hxg385,"Gas Fee Challenges across different blockchain When I first started in crypto, one of the challenges I faced was paying gas fees across different blockchains. For a newbie with low liquidity, it‚Äôs especially tough. I remember times when performing a simple task, like making a small transaction, would only require $1 in gas, but bridging funds to a specific blockchain could cost $5 or more. For someone with limited liquidity, those extra fees can eat into potential rewards and make navigating the space feel like an uphill battle.  
  
Just a few days ago, I wanted to mint an NFT that cost just $1, I tried bridging funds using Jumper Exchange, it would cost me $40. I had to forfeit it, and that‚Äôs just one example on a long list. How do you address this because it is currently affecting my experience. The cost of bridging could be frustrating and discouraging. I feel using one particular token as gas fees across blockchain could simplify the progress, for example BGB or BNB on Bitget and Binance wallet respectively",1

1iy3sha,"what's wrong using a decentralized application? I'm wondering what are the most important criteria for you before going to use a dApp (decentralized application) for fun? What do you check to trust a unknown dApp (or what is prohibitive)?

I ask this question because I develop a modest dApp for fun for friends/colleagues using Polygon (see my profil to learn more) which is easy to use (no registration needed for instance) and has a comprehensive FAQ page. The plateform has been referenced on DappRadar for over a year but without success (there are a few vissitors per week but no use). So I have obviously missed something important \^\^ (or I haven't found the right audience yet due to lack of advertising?)",1
1gsp7f2,"Grow a bag first, then invest Not sure what to title this post, but it applies to all investment markets not just cryptocurrency.

I have been investing since I was 18, and I am now 32. I made this mistake myself and I find that it is not often talked about online.¬†

In short: if you have a small bag (less than 50k) and you are looking to invest. IMO, don't.

Use that money and build something. The return on building a small business, a product, a freelancing company, learning a skill, taking a class, etc. will always be a far better ROI.

Let me explain with some numbers that were my own. At the age of 20, I had about $10,000 USD to invest. I researched and managed a return of 13%. This sounds good, but it was mostly luck. And even if it weren't it's still not enough.¬†

Let's extrapolate and say that I do this every year for 5 years.¬†
10k * 1.13 = $11,300
$11,300 * 1.13 = $12,769
‚Ä¶
Year 5 yields a total of $18,424.35 In 5 years, I made $8,424.35

This is not a life changing amount of money for 5 years.¬†

The trade of 5 years for 8,400 is not enough.

Instead, let's say I take that $10,000 and invest in myself.¬†

I take a coding bootcamp for $5000, get a job paying $20,000 more than I had previously, and in 1 year, I am up $15,000. I pay my taxes, and I am still at $10,000. I had to work, but I now have a skill. Over the next 3 years, I get 3 raises. I had to work anyway. The profits from my 10,000 are not nearly enough.¬†

It's far better to work on a skill than to invest with small amounts.¬†

However, instead let's say I have $100,000.¬†

This is quite different.¬†

My first year, I will make $13,000 in profits. Likely competitive with my annual raises at my coding job.¬†

After 5 years, I will have made $84,000 in interest.¬†

I could have even took 10k from that 100k to take more classes, invest in equipment, grow my skills, etc. and my returns will still be close to that.¬†
The mistake I made was investing too soon. Go work really hard when you are young, invest in yourself, build. your skills, and grow a bag. Then invest when you have a chunk.

As a final note: if you do invest in risky crypto markets and manage to hit 100k early on, sell it all, and switch to a slower strategy. You will have just skipped 5+ years of early investing and you are set up to win. Don't mess it up by gambling it.",1
1iyjdl6,"Is Matt Hougan right or wrong about the latest events? 

What's up guys? I just saw this Cointelegraph [post](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1894643566192071057?t=YGNEZ_vyzyhVd50U1lGzmg&s=19) that read Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has declared memecoin all the shady shit going on in crypto like Melania, Libra and the Lazarus Group laundering ETH. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll fade in two quarters‚ÄÇand Bitcoin adoption, stablecoins, DeFi take over.‚Äù While I agree on the second half, I totally desagree on the first. I‚Äôm bullish on memecoins, and I think he‚Äôs‚ÄÇjumping the gun.

Now, I differentiate the new memecoins to the old ones. The ones he mentioned are clearly a pump and dumb. But Shiba? PEPE? They are here to stay imo and I own both on my meme wallet. 

Memecoins are the party animals of crypto; they crash, they burn, but‚ÄÇthey're always back with a vengeance. Yes, this laundering drama sounds messy and scares a lot of people from crypto, but scandals come and‚ÄÇgo. Memecoins have withstood dog‚ÄÇpiles of hype, dumps, and memes before. They‚Äôre not going anywhere. It‚Äôs fun,‚ÄÇit‚Äôs chaos, and who doesn‚Äôt want to ride the next doge or shiba rocket? (that's what happened when PEPE came into the scene). 

This incident? It‚Äôll pass over, and‚ÄÇmemecoins will roar back with a vengeance at least that's my take. 

For that‚ÄÇmatter, I‚Äôm not losing sleep over the ‚Äúdrag on the market‚Äù chatter, either. While DeFi and stablecoins are dope,‚ÄÇshoutout to the memecoins lol.

Through a show of complete organic community power Kendu has managed to find its way in to the eyes of 3 T1 exchanges

Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase ranks 3rd, OKX 4th and Bitget 6th. These are the 3 who have noticed us.

As seen above, Kendu found itself placed top and centre on a Coinbase Wallet advertisement through our communities engagement alone. Now, every single other coin shown within that image has been listed except for Kendu. That meaning it is only a matter of time.

[Bitget Giveaway](https://preview.redd.it/5r5j1iadw64e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=23687b6b76793c04617e6ca8be3db09d5b88ca76)

Next, Bitget has randomly began a giveaway of 183.269M Kendu tokens. Several SE Asia Bitget workers have joined our community then this giveaway begins. They have also mentioned in the past through their CEO in a space with our dev, that when we reclaim ATH and the same volume as then, they will happily list us.

[OKX](https://preview.redd.it/osiz43sew64e1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=233daf841799449fcc7d8667e53a4250c6b2926a)

Currently running now aswell, we have an OKX campaign that allows users to earn rewards through signing up. There is also other rewards that can be given through this same campaign through trading on the app and giving volume!

so basically through pure hardwork, dedication and old school running it up, the KENDU community has single handedly been noticed by three top exchanges. To be noticed, yet alone have individual campaigns given out purely through the exchanges own desires, is so incredibly bullish it can not be understated. Now, imagine the future of kendu and what listings we might get when we start pulling back to ATH and getting that volume.

A coinbase ad, Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign.

What other coins do you see running on an OKX campaign, what other coins with a Bitget giveaway? Kendu is found sitting pretty with the likes of BTC and ETH on the coinbase ad aswell.

The thing is though, anyone can compete in the Bitget giveaway and OKX campaign! so if you yourself are interested in doing so, get competing! it is a wonderful opportunity for anyone, whether you are already a kendu holder or not, to try and win some goods through signing up for both the OKX campaign and the Bitget giveaway.

1go9ox8,"Sincere Bitcoin questions Hi everyone, I've never written any post ever since I joined Reddit, but today I have a couple  questions for you that I couldn't sleep over.

I've been holding a little Bitcoin for the last four years and I'm thrilled to see it's going up like a rocket right now. Really happy I didn't sell when I was in the deep red.

Right now I'm hesitating to add more sats, but I feel like in the near future a 10% or 15% drop is still possible. Is this the case? Should people wait for a drop? If people wish to invest (more) into Bitcoin now, Dollar Cost Averaging in and HODLing is always the right strategy, correct?

But here's my true questions: if we are still so early, and we'll be at 125k this cycle and 2million per BTC in 10-20 years, then why aren't we seeing about this in the news? Why aren't many more people realizing this than ever before? Why aren't millionaires buying shitloads of Bitcoin? And here's another one for you: if it's true that in 20 years BTC becomes the world reserve currency, wouldn't there be massive protests and anarchy because some people were just ""lucky"" to have realized the truth sooner than others? There will be angry people saying we stole THEIR Bitcoin and they still don't have any sats. What if then there will still be people not accepting the value of Bitcoin? Wouldn't there be enormous unrest and potential risks involved in such a paradigm shift?

Looking forward to hear your thoughts.",1

1hw9czb,"Transparency in Crypto: How $CMAFIA Is Setting the Standard for Trust The crypto space is full of big dreams but even bigger risks, and finding solid ground can be a challenge. Investing in new memecoin projects isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart. We‚Äôve all had those nights, thinking we‚Äôve aped into a great project, only to wake up to a negative balance and no liquidity to cash out.

Projects seem to pop up overnight, promising the moon, only to vanish just as quickly or leave you wondering what‚Äôs really happening behind the scenes. That‚Äôs where transparency becomes a game-changer. It‚Äôs not just a nice-to-have; it‚Äôs the foundation for trust, confidence, and long-term success in crypto.

**Let‚Äôs dive into why transparency matters, how it separates solid projects from shady ones, and how $CMAFIA is setting the standard for doing things right.**

# Why Transparency Is Everything

1. **It Builds Trust:** When devs are upfront about their plans, wallets, and progress, it shows the community they‚Äôve got nothing to hide. Trust is the glue that holds a project together, and transparency is how you earn it.
2. **It Keeps Investors Calm:** Nobody likes feeling left in the dark, especially when their money‚Äôs on the line. Transparency gives investors the confidence to hold through market dips instead of panic-selling at the first sign of trouble.
3. **It Stops FUD in Its Tracks:** Let‚Äôs be real, rumours and uncertainty spread like wildfire in crypto. But when devs are open and honest, there‚Äôs no room for FUD. It keeps the community focused and united.
4. **It Sets the Project Apart:** With so many rugs and scams out there, transparency makes a project stand out to serious investors. It‚Äôs like a big flashing sign that says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here for real.‚Äù

# What Real Transparency Looks Like

It‚Äôs one thing to say a project is transparent, but what does that actually mean? Here‚Äôs what you should look for:

* **Locked Wallets:** If the devs have locked their tokens, it‚Äôs a good sign they‚Äôre serious about the long-term success of the project.
* **Open Communication:** Regular updates, AMAs, and voice chats where devs actually show up and answer tough questions.
* **Visible Transactions:** Sharing wallet addresses so the community can track everything in real time. No mystery moves, no funny business.
* **Rewarding Loyalty:** Projects that actually give back to their community, airdrops, token rewards, or just straight-up appreciation.
* **Devs Who Show Up:** The best projects have devs who are in the trenches every day, engaging with the community and leading by example.

# Actions Speak Louder Than Words

In crypto, words are cheap. Any dev can hop into a community chat, offer reassurances, and promise they‚Äôre doing the right thing. But without actions to back it up, those words mean nothing. Transparency isn‚Äôt about what you *say* you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs about *showing* what you‚Äôre doing, clearly and consistently.

**If a project isn‚Äôt willing to provide locked wallets, visible transactions, or regular updates with tangible proof, it raises an important question: why not? Trust is built on evidence, not blind faith. In a space filled with promises that are broken as fast as they‚Äôre made, actions become the only reliable currency.**

At $CMAFIA, we don‚Äôt just talk about transparency; we live it. Our locked dev wallets, ID-verified team, and daily engagement with the community are all tangible actions that prove we‚Äôre here for the long haul. We share not only our successes but also the challenges we face, because we believe our community deserves to know exactly what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes.

Words might reassure, but actions build trust. And in crypto, trust is everything.

# How $CMAFIA Is Doing Things Differently

At $CMAFIA, transparency isn‚Äôt just a buzzword, it‚Äôs the backbone of everything we do. We believe in creating a project that prioritises trust, collaboration, and long-term value. Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre setting ourselves apart from the rest:

**1. Open Dev Inbox:**  
We‚Äôve created a dev inbox that‚Äôs an open topic in our Telegram group, allowing anyone to communicate directly with us. The best part? It‚Äôs visible to the entire community, ensuring transparency in every interaction.

**2. Discussions Over Decisions:**  
We don‚Äôt just dismiss suggestions. Instead, we engage in meaningful discussions with our community in the main chat. We take the time to explain our decisions, ensuring everyone understands the reasoning behind them. Our community knows their voice matters, and no one is ever shut down for speaking up.

**3. Education Over Dictation:**  
We believe in empowering our community through education, not blind instructions. That‚Äôs why we focus on producing quality articles on Reddit, hosting open discussions, and sharing insights that help our members understand not just $CMAFIA, but the broader crypto space. Knowledge is power, and we‚Äôre here to share it.

**4. Locked Team Tokens:**  
With 80M tokens locked for three months, we‚Äôve ensured that our community doesn‚Äôt have to worry about shady dumps. When the lock ends, we‚Äôll have an open discussion with the community about re-locking, reinforcing our commitment to their trust.

**5. ID-Verified Devs:**  
Our dev team isn‚Äôt hiding behind anonymity. We‚Äôre fully verified and even blue-ticked on X (Twitter). You see us daily‚Äîshowing up, engaging, and proving our dedication to the project.

**6. Daily Community Engagement:**  
We‚Äôre in the trenches every day‚Äîanswering questions, hosting AMAs, and working alongside our community. We don‚Äôt believe in sitting back and watching; we‚Äôre grinding just as hard as you are.

**7. Mod Rewards:**  
Our Telegram mods are the unsung heroes of $CMAFIA, and we‚Äôve rewarded them with 2M tokens each to show our appreciation for their time, effort, and loyalty. They‚Äôre not just mods; they‚Äôre part of The Family.

**8. Organic Growth:**  
We‚Äôre not interested in chasing unsustainable pumps or gaming the system. Instead, we‚Äôre focused on steady, organic growth that builds a foundation for long-term success. This approach attracts long-term holders who believe in our vision.

**9. Open Conversations and Accountability:**  
Every move we make is open for discussion. Whether it‚Äôs locking tokens, launching marketing initiatives, or navigating challenges, we keep our community informed and involved every step of the way.

**10. Breaking the Mold:**  
We‚Äôre not just another crypto project. We‚Äôre redefining what a culture coin can be, an inclusive, supportive, and transparent environment where everyone has a voice and a role to play.

With $CMAFIA, you‚Äôre not just investing in a token; you‚Äôre joining a movement. Together, we‚Äôre proving that crypto can be done differently, and we‚Äôre proud to lead by example.

# Leaving You with This

Transparency isn‚Äôt just a buzzword, it‚Äôs the backbone of any successful project. It‚Äôs what builds trust, instills confidence, and fosters a community that stays loyal through the highs and lows. In a space saturated with rugs, hype, and empty promises, transparency is the line that separates the good projects from the bad. It‚Äôs the foundation that makes a project not just survive, but thrive.

At $CMAFIA, we believe that actions speak louder than words. We don‚Äôt rely on flashy gimmicks or temporary pumps to create excitement. Instead, we‚Äôre committed to showing up every day, proving ourselves through transparency, hard work, and a long-term vision. 

**Whether it‚Äôs locked wallets, verified devs, or open discussions in our community chat, every decision we make is rooted in trust and accountability.**

We know that crypto can feel chaotic, even discouraging at times. But we also know that with the right approach, it can be a space where genuine communities thrive and real opportunities are built. 

**$CMAFIA is here to prove that you don‚Äôt need smoke and mirrors to succeed, you just need the courage to do things differently and the commitment to follow through.**

To everyone who‚Äôs been part of our journey so far, thank you for trusting us. To those who are just joining The Family, welcome. Together, we‚Äôre setting a new standard for what crypto can be. And we‚Äôre just getting started.

üíéüî´ **If you‚Äôre tired of projects that keep you in the dark, come join The Family and see what transparency really looks like.**

Yesterday ETH traded in a range of $3659-$3746 and ended the day at +0.11% ü¶Ä. ETH/BTC closed at 0.03814 yesterday (-0.73%).

Traditional markets reacted today with a stronger dollar and lower stock prices, as Trump‚Äôs tariff threat toward BRICS over the weekend dampened sentiment. He said that he would impose 100% tariffs if they tried to move away from the US dollar by creating their own currency. However, since anything related to Trump is net positive for crypto, I believe that the crypto markets will be shielded from any negative impact of Trump‚Äôs tariff threats for the time being. 

Today‚Äôs data showed that the US ISM manufacturing PMI was higher at 48.4 compared to the forecast of 47.7 and previous figure of 46.5. This indicates strength in the manufacturing sector in the US, and may further support the view that the US economy is outperforming other developed markets, which made it to a slower pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

Looking ahead to tomorrow there is Switzerland Consumer Price Index, which is forecast to be -0.1% month-on-month, supporting the case for more rate cuts from the Swiss National Bank. After that there is US JOLTS Job Openings data, which historically hasn‚Äôt been a very important labor market indicator, but traders now are hungry for employment data from US that there is a potential for some strong reaction from this. 

Today ETH opened at $3707 and was last traded at $3646 at 15:10 UTC (-1.65%).

Happy trading Ethtraders! üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ",1

1gvhyvu,"ZRX/USDT Analysis ‚Äì Bullish Bias with Some Caution **Long hold \[4-6 weeks\]**   
  
Hey everyone, here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of why I think ZRX/USDT could be heading bullish on a longer scale using the weekly chart for analysis, We are a key point and I believe there could be a long awaited reversal here over the next few days (I still feel there will be a few more red days before we see this reversal). There are a few things to keep an eye on:

1. **Price Action & Moving Averages**
   * Current price: $0.4218, up 14.59% this week.
   * The price is currently **above all key moving averages**:
      * **MA7**: $0.3489
      * **MA25**: $0.3397
      * **MA99**: $0.3351
   * **Bullish signal**: The price is comfortably above these levels, indicating a strong bullish trend across short, medium, and long terms. These MAs could now act as support if the price retraces.
2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   * **RSI(6)**: 69.72 ‚Äî Getting close to overbought territory (70). Not quite there yet, but it shows strong bullish momentum.
   * **What to watch**: If RSI crosses 70, we might see a stronger bull trend. However, if it stays too high for too long, a pullback could be on the horizon. So, the RSI is signaling strength, but it‚Äôs approaching a level where we need to be cautious about short-term corrections.
3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
   * **MACD(20, 50, 9)**: The MACD line is at **-0.0195**, just above the signal line at **-0.0219**.
   * The histogram is positive, which means **bullish momentum** is gaining strength. Although it‚Äôs still below zero, the MACD crossover is a sign that the trend might be flipping bullish.
4. **Volume**
   * There's been an **increase in volume** lately, which supports the price increase. When volume picks up, it typically shows that the move is being backed by real buying interest, not just speculative spikes.
   * If this volume continues, it would confirm the current move as genuine.

# Bullish Signals:

* Price is above major moving averages.
* RSI is strong, nearing the overbought zone but still in bullish territory.
* MACD crossover and positive histogram signal growing bullish momentum.
* Volume supports the move, suggesting strength behind the rally.

# Bearish Risk:

* RSI is creeping up on 70, so we could see a short-term pullback if it enters the overbought region.
* MACD is still below zero, so this might be an early stage rally ‚Äî don‚Äôt expect the trend to last forever without a solid break above zero.

# Conclusion:

I‚Äôm leaning **bullish** on ZRX/USDT here. The price action, moving averages, RSI, MACD, and volume are all pointing to a potential continuation upwards. But keep an eye on the RSI, volume trends, and watch for a breakout above 70 on RSI ‚Äî that could be your signal for a possible pullback.",0

1i2tw45,"Suggestions for Reducing High Gas Fees in Dynamic Asset Rebalancing  Hi everyone,

I am currently working on a project involving **dynamic asset rebalancing** within a decentralized finance protocol. Our setup uses modular smart contracts.However, we are facing a challenge related to **gas fees**.

Currently, our smart contracts source liquidity from decentralized exchanges like **Uniswap** on Ethereum. Every time rebalancing occurs the gas fees are extremely high making the process non - sustainable for users.

To solve this I am considering deploying the same modular smart contracts on other chains, such as **Base** or **Arbitrum**, to take advantage of their lower fees and faster transaction speeds. While this seems like a logical solution, I want to explore other innovative or **out-of-the-box ideas** that the community might suggest.

For example:

* Are there any creative ways to optimize liquidity sourcing without incurring such high gas fees?
* Would deploying on L2s be the best approach, or is there an alternative that could work better for dynamic rebalancing??

I‚Äôm open to all suggestions and ideas.",1

1ib5go7,"Ethereum: Ranked #34 Among 18,000 Global Assets - Why Noise and Fear Distort Its True Potential Today I bring you something different to put some perspective in front of all of you and show you how big Ethereum is and how some people visions are distorted because of the noise and because Ethereum falls into crypto category and not just into regular company.

[25-48 Top assets](https://preview.redd.it/bjnikz7ekife1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=439d6ed2c45d137cf0e8b9c6655b0b05f2697bab)

As you can see in the rank above, Ethereum is currently at 34 position compared with over 18,000 assets in the whole world. Ethereum currently has $368.91 Billion market cap making it above very important companies like Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, SAP, Salesforce, Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and the list continue.

[24 top assets](https://preview.redd.it/np74ul4ikife1.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=291e5f603beb77134604de4c2ba6886e1c137e73)

There are only 34 assets above Ethereum right now and I am pretty sure that a lot of them will go under Ethereum in the coming years due to the adoption increasing and all the use of cases that will have, even used for a lot of the companies you see in the list.

With all of this in front of you, adding a lot of perspective to our brains, the conclusion would be something like ""Why am I afraid or I don't believe in Ethereum if I would blindly invest my money into assets like Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Netflix, etc."". Well, the answer is quite simple, ""noise"" and ""fear to the unknown"".

Ethereum and crypto in general are a whole new thing and nobody is 100% certain about what will happen next, however with stock, they have a lot of time in the market and this somehow give us unconscious security that they are safe. Regarding the noise, you see it every day, mainstream media is always trying to make some noise with any kind of stupid price move or stupid ""influencer"" quote.

The goal of this post is to basically add perspective and give you another tool to throw you back into the reality when there is too much noise so you can calmy decide what to do next. I hope it helped.

Learned about the tech and the system proved really interesting. I know I still have a lot to learn and I tend to play it safe as I am a more traditional investor.

Anyway, long story short, instead of roaming and searching for the ¬´¬†gem¬†¬ª that will moon, I went with am index approach. By that I mean I took the 20 first coins by market caps, excluding stablecoins and meme coins.

Obviously I am aiming for the long term.

It also shows that they are not profitable and their only revenue is from the app they sell users to ""mine"" more xyo. If you just bought the xyo with the fees you would get more. They dont sell data like they claim and that report proves it.

Their new chain will pay out stake. Name one chain that pays stake and does not infalte? New users and people chasing this news need to understand that the next news they drop with the chain operational will be that XYO is removing the max cap and or printing a fresh supply to pay for the stake. This will be damaging to the price of XYO no doubt.

but if you take a quick look its only trading 100 bucks worth a day.

This is a quote from that statement.

""For the six months ended June¬†30, 2024, the Company recognized a net loss of $610,291. The Company was not able to cover its operational costs with the product and services sales generated and will likely need to further invest in marketing for user acquisition to increase COIN App income and advertising revenue to reach break-even for its products and services. As a result, the Company may incur further operating losses and seek to fund its operations through equity and/or debt financing or other sources, as it deems necessary. Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions or unforeseen factors. If the Company fails to raise capital or generate liquidity through the sale of its products and services, it will have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies. Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern from the filing date of this Semi-Annual Report on Form¬†1-SA. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.""

The company owns 800 mil XYO and 0 btc as per that statement but they owe 500 mil of those out to warrants. Here is another quote from that paper.

""In 2019, the Company issued XYO Token warrants to consultants. The warrants enable the holders thereof to purchase XYO Tokens at a fixed price for up to 10 years. These warrants were deemed to be a form of additional compensation and an obligation, rather than equity, however, as the warrants are tied to an internally developed intangible asset, the XYO Token. Therefore, no value has been ascribed to them. As of June¬†30, 2024 and December¬†31, 2023, respectively, the Company recognized no provisional liability from the XYO Warrants granted. The Company had 13 and 13 outstanding warrants for a total of 258,387,376¬†and 312,387,376 XYO tokens as of June¬†30, 2024 and December¬†31, 2023, respectively. The Company paid out 36,905,433 XYO tokens under the XYO warrant plan during the six months ended June¬†30, 2024.""

TLDR 0 FUD all facts, this company is a sinking ship and anyone buying or thinking about it needs to look at these reports that clearly show a company on the verge of bankruptcy.",1

Data today from the Eurozone was showing that Eurozone Consumer Confidence index was at -14 in January, slightly better than the -15 from December but still deeply negative and below the long term average.

Meanwhile UK data showed that manufacturing sector sentiment was slightly better in January but still weak, with the CBI Industrial Order Expectations index at -34 compared to the previous month figure that was showing a number of -40.

* (Analysis): As expected, sentiment in the Eurozone and UK remains weak in general, with many uncertainties including higher energy prices, uncertainty over Trump trade policy and also domestic issues continuing to affect the region.

# Canada and US Update

Canada data showed Retail Sales was flat in November at 0%, which was weaker than the estimate data of +0.2% and also the previous number which was showing +0.6%. When we zoom into the report we can see that weaker food and beverage retailer sales was the biggest reason for the lower numbers, and sales were lower in six out of nine subsectors for the report.

Meanwhile when we move on to US data we can see that the Unemployment Claims for the week ending 18^(th) January was higher at 223k compared to the forecast 221k and the previous week numbers that show 217k. Looking at more report details we can see the 4-week moving average was 213,500, higher than the previous week‚Äôs 4-week average at 212,750. The last figure we can analyze from the report shows the continuing claims increased as well to 1.899 million for week ending 11^(th) January, higher than the previous week‚Äôs number of 1.859 million.

* (Analysis): Canada is continuing to show weak data, and with even more uncertainty coming as Trump threatens tariffs on them, it seems like the situation could get even worse and may lead to policymakers having to give more support through rate cuts. Now when we look at the US data it shows all three metrics which are the headline future, the 4-week average and the continuing claims are all higher, pointing to underlying labour market weakness. We will need more data points for sure but a weaker job market could eventually lead to repricing of the number and timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

# Crypto Update

ETH 24h +0.08%, ETH 7d -2.33%, ETH 30d -6.92%

BTC 24h +1.74%, BTC 7d +6.11%, BTC 30d +7.38%

* (Analysis): ETH is underperforming BTC on all timeframes, and with the CMC Altcoin Index now at 44/100 it seems hardly surprising. Despite some positive headlines for ETH, including a report on Cointelegraph that staking ETFs could soon be approved, ETH still can‚Äôt seem to be catching any momentum or hype. Looks like Bitcoin season is here to stay for now.

It's worse if you're new, and you're still trying to understand how it works, asides the fact that you don't know a lot, there are people constantly out to get you, and one slip can mean getting scammed of everything you own. 

  
But like most things there are two sides to this, you can also benefit a lot from interacting with crypto in many ways, it also helps that there are forums and subs online like this one, that makes interacting with crypto a lot easier. 

I cannot count the amount of times, I've seen threads here talking about different ways to approach crypto securely, and protect yourself from scams. 

  
I know crypto can be brutal but I've seen a lot of actions taken in good faith, I remember when they started payouts for FTX victims recently, I saw on X that some of them that showed their compensation application got an extra 2500 USDT from CEX like Bitget.

By the ATH in April, I think, I had put around $60k into bitcoin. I watched the price slide and slide some more. Then I started a more rational DCA plan. I purchased small amounts all the way down to $16k in late 2022. That felt like blood in the streets.

My avg now is $47k. My profit right now is 85%. It was more fun when it was over  100% but my point is that while it may be uncomfortable, your holding the best performing secure asset of all time.

 * Pay your bills
 * Live a good life 
 * Grow cash your savings
 * DCA into bitcoin
 * Read about self custody 

Stop treating cash like it's the devil. Cash will save your bitcoin. It's an important part of holding bitcoin.

So if your new and bought at the ATH, relax. If it goes to 16k again we'll all be selling lemonade to buy bitcoin.

1ho39ii,"Let‚Äôs Talk About the Elephant in the Room: Why Some Coins Will Never Reach $1 Let's talk about the elephant in the room, some coins won't ever reach $1 and the reason is Market Cap.

As investors we all experience a growth to become real investors but that road is not simple and we make a lot of mistakes especially in the beginning of our journeys making us lose money in the process. These mistakes happens basically for lack of education regarding economy, investments, etc.

The goal of this post is basically talk a bit about a really simple concept that will prevent newcomers reading this post to fall in the fake promises of a token reaching X price, etc. That important simple thing is Market Cap.

# What is a market cap?

A market cap is the total value of an asset which is calculated multiplying its price by the total circulating supply. (Don't worry, portfolio trackers like CoinGecko or CMC do the job for you).

This metric is very important to put your feet in the ground and ""estimate"" a price of a target comparing with other tokens in the market.

# Why some tokens won't ever reach $1?

Simple, the supply is too large and dont get tricked by ""burning"" supply tokens feature in a not calculated and healthy way to keep the inflation on track due to the necessities of the project. Yes, I am talking about you SHIB.

# SHIB Price Perspective Example:

One of my favorite tools to put some perspective is The Coin perspective tool ([https://thecoinperspective.com/](https://thecoinperspective.com/)). Lets check SHIB and what it needs to reach $1.

[SHIB with BTC current market cap](https://preview.redd.it/tzrhyhvfik9e1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d01f4c143636ebf4523a354f8bf1aea9c5e5df1)

As you can see, SHIB had BTCs market cap of $1.9T  it will be worth $0.0032.

[SHIB $1](https://preview.redd.it/mctzmh8sik9e1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fca1e3890a3f88c1db2f20e50afc811fe37304a)

Now if SHIB reached $1 it would require $589.3T market cap. As you can imagine, there is not such amount of money in the world. Currently $80T ([https://www.under30ceo.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world/](https://www.under30ceo.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world/)).

With this I want to show you to prevent you for falling in this kind of insane trends and realistically play with those tokens if you want. Yes, you can still make money investing/gambling on them.

Stay safe and educate yourself!

1i1xf8r,"Pocket or Broker: what's the cheaper way to buy Bitcoin? I currently buy BTC daily for 10 USD via my broker. With my BitBox02, I could also execute daily BTC purchases via Pocket and have the BTC sent directly to my BitBox. 

With my broker, I first have to convert CHF to USD for a fee of 0.95% per transaction. And then I pay another 1% fee for each purchase of Bitcoin. This currently adds up to about 5.55 CHF per month.

On Pocket, I would pay a 1.5% feee for each purchase of Bitcoin, which would amount to about 4.05 CHF each month when buying BTC daily for 10 CHF. However, the UTXO management implications with Pocket for long-term use are not considered in this calculation (with Pocket, the transactions are made directly on the Blockchain unlike with my broker where the transactions take place on a centralized exchange and all transactions are recorded in the internal ledger and not on the blockchain). 

Assuming an average fee rate (10 satoshis/byte) and a Bitcoin price of $96,000, consolidating 360 UTXOs could cost approximately $235.10 in transaction fees per year. While with one monthly purchase of 300 CHF, the consolidation fee per year would be at only 7.94 USD. Or with 4 monthly purchases of 75 CHF each, the consolidation fee would be 31.43 USD. However, I do want to buy daily to flatten out price volatility.

I am looking for the cheapest and most low-effort way for managing my recurring purchases. Considering the cost of accumulating UTXO via daily buys, I think it might be easiest to continue buying daily via my broker and transferring to my hardware wallet every 10-12 months. Or I switch to Pocket and buy weekly or even monthly, with the downside of not reducing price volatility as much as I would with daily buys.

Bybit immediately scrambled to shore up liquidity and reassure customers. It **replenished reserves** through emergency measures ‚Äì reportedly taking out **loans from rival exchanges** (e.g. Bitget, MEXC) and securing large deposits to replace the stolen ETH ([Bybit Takes Loans From Rivals After Record Crypto Hack](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/bybit-takes-loans-from-rivals-after-record-crypto-hack#:~:text=Bybit%20Takes%20Loans%20From%20Rivals,so%20Bybit%27s%20customers%20can)). In total, over **120,000 ETH** was provided as **short-term emergency support** from external investors and platforms ([""Bybit Receives Emergency Support of 120K ETH from 5 Individuals ...](https://bloomingbit.io/en/feed/news/83742#:~:text=,Major)). Bybit‚Äôs CEO Ben Zhou maintained that all user assets remained 1:1 backed, and indeed **impacted customers were fully paid out**.

These efforts contained the immediate fallout, but the hack‚Äôs shock to market sentiment was clear. The **liquidity crunch** at Bybit and fears of contagion contributed to a sharp slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin fell roughly 20% from its recent high (down to the mid-$80Ks), and Ether‚Äôs rebound was short-lived as fresh sell-pressure hit. Notably, some traders had expected Bybit‚Äôs massive ETH purchases to *boost* prices post-hack; instead, Ether‚Äôs price **continued dropping** even as Bybit bought \~$740M of ETH ‚Äì suggesting other forces were driving the market down ([Ethereum price drops despite Bybit reportedly buying $700M ETH ‚Äî Why?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-price-drops-despite-bybit-reportedly-buying-700m-eth-why#:~:text=Ether%20%28ETH%29%20price%20dropped%205,this%20scenario%20did%20not%20materialize)) ([Ethereum price drops despite Bybit reportedly buying $700M ETH ‚Äî Why?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-price-drops-despite-bybit-reportedly-buying-700m-eth-why#:~:text=Vance%20Spencer%2C%20co,could%20drive%20Ether%E2%80%99s%20price%20higher)).

# Claims of Coordinated Market Manipulation

One prominent crypto analyst (pseudonym **‚ÄúMartyParty‚Äù**) alleged that **several big exchanges colluded to dump the market** ahead of the crash ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=A%20crypto%20commentator%20and%20analyst,the%20amounts%20involved%20are%20enormous)). According to this theory, exchanges like **Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken** **transferred large amounts of ETH and SOL to the market maker Wintermute**, who then aggressively sold those assets, pushing prices down. MartyParty shared on-chain data purportedly showing Binance sending **25,000 ETH (\~$80M)** and **100,000 SOL** to Wintermute before the big drop ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20few%20days%2C,and%20Ethereum%20for%20various%20reasons)). He implied these players were **trading on privileged information**, unloading coins *‚Äúbefore things happen‚Äù* ‚Äì i.e. just before the hack news and crash became public ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=A%20crypto%20commentator%20and%20analyst,the%20amounts%20involved%20are%20enormous)). This coordinated sell-off would have **liquidated many longs** (stop-loss orders and leveraged long positions), exacerbating the price plunge. Indeed, on the weekend of one steep decline, over **$8‚Äì10 billion** in crypto positions got liquidated across exchanges as prices cascaded lower ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20morning%2C%20bitcoin%20,crashed%20from%20%24212%20to%20%24176)).

**Wintermute** ‚Äì a leading algorithmic market maker ‚Äì was central to these claims. The theory posits that exchanges *routed their selling through Wintermute* to hide their tracks, since Wintermute provides liquidity on many exchanges. MartyParty went so far as to claim **‚Äúthere was no hack‚Äù** at Bybit and that this was all a cover story for *‚Äúthe biggest corruption in the history of CEXs‚Äù* (centralized exchanges) ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=But%20that%27s%20not%20all%2C%20the,price%20between%20yesterday%20and%20today)). In his view, **major exchanges might have shorted ETH**, orchestrated a crash (under the guise of the hack), then had Bybit **buy back ETH at rock-bottom prices** ‚Äì benefiting the insiders. He noted that *‚ÄúETH dropped a lot‚Ä¶and Bybit bought it at an even lower price‚Äù* during the dip, implying this was by design ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=But%20that%27s%20not%20all%2C%20the,price%20between%20yesterday%20and%20today)). In short, the conjecture is that a cabal of exchanges **loaned ETH to Bybit**, then **dumped the market to profit and allow Bybit to rebuy cheaply**, stabilizing Bybit‚Äôs books while the manipulators earn from shorts and liquidations.

These allegations gained traction on social media, with users accusing exchanges of **insider trading and market abuse**. Some pointed out that **Kraken and Coinbase** had also been observed sending crypto to Wintermute around that time ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=Binance%20was%20not%20the%20only,corruption%20in%20the%20CEX%20domain)). Others highlighted that **Wintermute** could directly profit from triggering liquidations, since market makers often take the opposite side of traders‚Äô stop-loss orders ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=When%20a%20customer%20sets%20a,a%20liquidation%20of%20that%20stop)). (Wintermute, as a liquidity provider, can benefit when a cascade of stop-loss sell orders let it buy back cheaper, or vice versa.) This isn‚Äôt the first time such suspicions have arisen ‚Äì when markets crash, traders frequently blame shadowy forces. For example, back in 2018, BitMEX‚Äôs CEO **Arthur Hayes** admitted he ran a for-profit trading desk on his own exchange that **profited from customer liquidations** ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=When%20markets%20crash%2C%20traders%20often,profited%20from%20his%20customers%E2%80%99%20liquidations)), cementing many traders‚Äô cynicism. With that history in mind, the idea of exchanges covertly trading against their users doesn‚Äôt seem far-fetched to some.

However, **no hard proof** has emerged that Bybit‚Äôs hack was ‚Äúfaked‚Äù or that exchanges conspired to attack the market. What we do have are **suspicious correlations** and *unanswered questions*. Blockchain analytics from Arkham did confirm that **Binance sent large crypto tranches to Wintermute** in late February ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20few%20days%2C,and%20Ethereum%20for%20various%20reasons)). This fueled the speculation ‚Äì was Binance itself dumping holdings? Binance officially **denied ‚Äúdumping‚Äù ETH or SOL**, stating it was merely facilitating user trades through a market maker ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=%28%2416,to%20Wintermute)). A Binance spokesperson urged the community *‚Äúnot to jump to conclusions‚Äù* from raw transaction screenshots, calling the accusations FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)). It‚Äôs possible these transfers were **user withdrawals or liquidity provisioning** to Wintermute, rather than Binance selling its own assets. **Coinbase and Kraken** did not publicly comment on the rumors, but onlookers noted that large moves to Wintermute could simply be those exchanges using Wintermute‚Äôs services for bulk trade execution.

MartyParty and others remain convinced something nefarious occurred, pointing to the timing and scale of sales. They argue that **Bybit‚Äôs rapid recovery** (restoring much of its ETH reserves within days) is evidence of planning ‚Äì claiming no small exchange could magically plug a $1.5B hole without ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù On Reddit, users speculated that the **‚Äúemergency support‚Äù loans** to Bybit were not altruistic, but strategic. One comment suggested these short-term loans give the lending exchanges **first claim on Bybit‚Äôs assets** if it goes bust, essentially positioning them to **buy out Bybit‚Äôs carcass in bankruptcy** ([Bybit hack, withdrawals top $5.3B, but ‚Äòreserves exceed liabilities‚Äô ‚Äî Hacken : r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ivkk30/bybit_hack_withdrawals_top_53b_but_reserves/#:~:text=These%20short%20terms%20funds%20were,here%2C%20bybit%20is%20likely%20done)). In that cynical view, *‚Äúthere is no altruism here‚Äù* ([Bybit hack, withdrawals top $5.3B, but ‚Äòreserves exceed liabilities‚Äô ‚Äî Hacken : r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ivkk30/bybit_hack_withdrawals_top_53b_but_reserves/#:~:text=These%20short%20terms%20funds%20were,here%2C%20bybit%20is%20likely%20done)) ‚Äì rival exchanges stepped in to contain fallout (protecting the industry‚Äôs image and their own exposure), and possibly to profit from the situation. Again, these claims are unproven, but they underscore the atmosphere of distrust.

# Wintermute‚Äôs Involvement and Response

**Wintermute** sits at the center of the storm. As a leading market maker, Wintermute provides deep liquidity on exchanges like Binance and Coinbase ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=Wintermute%20is%20a%20market%20maker%2C,digital%20asset%20exchanges%20like%20Binance)). It‚Äôs known to handle large order flows and arbitrage between venues. When massive selling struck ETH and SOL markets, Wintermute was a natural intermediary. Traders angered by the liquidations pointed fingers at Wintermute, accusing it of **orchestrating a ‚Äústop-loss hunting‚Äù expedition**. Over that volatile weekend, Bitcoin briefly wicked down \~7% and Ethereum \~15%, and **billions in long positions were wiped out** ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20morning%2C%20bitcoin%20,crashed%20from%20%24212%20to%20%24176)). Meme posts and tweets circulated blaming Wintermute for ‚Äúsending prices to the shadow realm‚Äù to liquidate over-leveraged traders. This echoes past incidents ‚Äì e.g., **Wintermute was accused of profiting from a series of stop-loss triggers earlier in February**, after quotes from its team about record profits made the rounds on X (Twitter) ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=Bemoaning%20billions%20of%20dollars%20in,quants%20about%20their%20shocking%20profits)).

Wintermute‚Äôs CEO, **Evgeny Gaevoy**, addressed the allegations publicly. He **rejected the notion** that Wintermute and Binance colluded to crash the market, and tried to dispel fears of another FTX-style malicious scheme ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=However%2C%20Wintermute%20CEO%20Evgeny%20Gaevoy,Luna%20debacle%20in%20the%20making)) ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20Gaevoy%20says,bearing%20down%20on%20the%20market)). Gaevoy explained on X that Wintermute‚Äôs transfers and trades were part of normal market-making operations, not directional bets. He noted that **Wintermute is actually a primary counterparty** for many large exchanges ‚Äì handling their institutional order flow ‚Äì so seeing funds move between Wintermute and exchanges isn‚Äôt evidence of wrongdoing per se ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=More%20specifically%2C%20Wintermute%2C%20a%20digital,the%20center%20of%20these%20allegations)) ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=According%20to%20crypto%20sleuth%20Marty,they%20will%20sell%20their%20positions)). Importantly, Gaevoy pointed to **broader macro factors** weighing on crypto prices: *‚Äúlook at the macro‚Äù* he urged, citing things like **Trump‚Äôs tariff announcements** and other external pressures that coincided with the sell-off ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20Gaevoy%20says,bearing%20down%20on%20the%20market)). In his view, the market drop could be explained by **negative news and liquidity fears** post-hack, rather than a grand conspiracy. Wintermute also emphasized that, unlike the failed trading shops of the past, it doesn‚Äôt take huge unhedged directional positions that would benefit from such a crash ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=However%2C%20Wintermute%20CEO%20Evgeny%20Gaevoy,Luna%20debacle%20in%20the%20making)). In short, Wintermute‚Äôs stance is that it was *reacting* to market moves (and providing liquidity) ‚Äì not causing them.

That said, Wintermute does acknowledge it has a unique role. Gaevoy mentioned Wintermute often ends up as the **‚Äúnumber one counterparty‚Äù** to major players, meaning it frequently executes large trades for them ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=investors%20from%20positions.%20,counterparty%20for%20Binance%20and%20Coinbase)) ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=center%20of%20these%20allegations)). This intertwined relationship (e.g. *‚ÄúWintermute and Binance enter the stage‚Äù* whenever big tokens move ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L170%20Wintermute%20and,%E2%80%9D))) understandably raises eyebrows. It can be hard for outsiders to distinguish normal liquidity operations from potential collusion. For now, **no concrete evidence** has surfaced that Wintermute acted improperly in the Bybit saga. But the episode has renewed calls for greater **transparency** around how exchanges and market makers operate ‚Äì especially when insiders could exploit knowledge of events like exchange hacks before the public finds out.

# Historical Precedents of Exchange Bailouts & Manipulation

The crypto industry has seen **echoes of this playbook before** ‚Äì both genuine rescues and shady market manipulation. A few relevant examples:

* **Mt. Gox‚Äôs ‚ÄúWilly Bot‚Äù (2013)** ‚Äì In Bitcoin‚Äôs early days, the Mt. Gox exchange infamously ran automated trading bots that massively distorted the market. Research later showed that two bots (‚ÄúWilly‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarkus‚Äù) engaged in **600,000 BTC of fake buy orders** from Feb to Nov 2013, likely **pumping Bitcoin‚Äôs price from \~$150 to over $1,000** in two months ([Fraudulent Trading Drove Bitcoin's $150-to-$1,000 Rise in 2013: Paper](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/#:~:text=soon%20to%20be%20published%C2%A0in%20the,than%20%241%2C000%20in%20two%20months)). This was presumably an attempt to cover Mt. Gox‚Äôs insolvency at the time. It worked until it didn‚Äôt ‚Äì Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014, but the precedent was set: an exchange secretly manipulating prices to its advantage ([Fraudulent Trading Drove Bitcoin's $150-to-$1,000 Rise in 2013: Paper](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/#:~:text=Since%20January%202014%2C%20a%20theory,likely%20caused)) ([Fraudulent Trading Drove Bitcoin's $150-to-$1,000 Rise in 2013: Paper](https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/#:~:text=soon%20to%20be%20published%C2%A0in%20the,than%20%241%2C000%20in%20two%20months)).  
* **Bitfinex Hack and Tether (2016)** ‚Äì When Bitfinex was hacked for 120,000 BTC in 2016, the exchange spread losses to customers via ‚ÄúBFX tokens,‚Äù later redeeming them, and was suspected of using its sister company Tether to fill holes. In 2019, the New York AG revealed Bitfinex had also **borrowed hundreds of millions from Tether‚Äôs reserves** to cover a prior loss ([Binance plans to buy rival FTX in bailout as crypto market crumbles | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cryptocurrencies-slide-concerns-over-ftx-exchange-rattle-markets-2022-11-08/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FLONDON%2C%20Nov%208%20%28Reuters%29%20,concerns%20among%20investors%20about%20cryptocurrencies)) ([Binance plans to buy rival FTX in bailout as crypto market crumbles | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cryptocurrencies-slide-concerns-over-ftx-exchange-rattle-markets-2022-11-08/#:~:text=The%20deal%20between%20high,72%20hours%20before%20Tuesday%20morning)). This blurred the line between genuine bailout and potential fraud, and some traders believe it propped up crypto prices artificially via **unbacked USDT issuance**. (Bitfinex eventually repaid Tether, but the incident fueled lasting conspiracy theories.)  
* **BitMEX‚Äôs Liquidation Engine (2018)** ‚Äì As mentioned, BitMEX was long suspected of trading against its own customers. CEO Arthur Hayes admitted that BitMEX operated a secret market-making desk (‚ÄúInternal Trading‚Äù) that profited from **engineered liquidations** on the exchange ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=When%20markets%20crash%2C%20traders%20often,profited%20from%20his%20customers%E2%80%99%20liquidations)). This confirmed many traders‚Äô fears that derivatives exchanges can directly benefit when clients get wiped out, a huge conflict of interest.  
* **Binance‚Äôs Attempted FTX Bailout (2022)** ‚Äì In a high-profile episode of exchange triage, Binance **signed a non-binding agreement to acquire FTX** in November 2022 when FTX faced a liquidity crunch ([Binance plans to buy rival FTX in bailout as crypto market crumbles | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cryptocurrencies-slide-concerns-over-ftx-exchange-rattle-markets-2022-11-08/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FLONDON%2C%20Nov%208%20%28Reuters%29%20,concerns%20among%20investors%20about%20cryptocurrencies)). This was seen as a potential *bailout* to stem a wider crypto crash. (Binance ultimately backed out, and FTX collapsed.) It showed that in crises, exchanges might step in to rescue or absorb competitors to prevent contagion ‚Äì but also that such deals can fall apart, worsening market panic. Earlier that year, multiple firms (Voyager, BlockFi) sought bailouts after the Terra/Luna collapse; FTX‚Äôs founder Sam Bankman-Fried even provided emergency loans to some, until his own firm went under ([Binance plans to buy rival FTX in bailout as crypto market crumbles | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cryptocurrencies-slide-concerns-over-ftx-exchange-rattle-markets-2022-11-08/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2FLONDON%2C%20Nov%208%20%28Reuters%29%20,concerns%20among%20investors%20about%20cryptocurrencies)) ([Binance plans to buy rival FTX in bailout as crypto market crumbles | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/cryptocurrencies-slide-concerns-over-ftx-exchange-rattle-markets-2022-11-08/#:~:text=Binance%20would%20liquidate%20its%20holdings,recent%20revelations)).  
* **Ronin Bridge Hack (2022)** ‚Äì After the $615M Axie Infinity/Ronin bridge hack, Binance led a group of investors to inject $150M to reimburse users ([Crypto exchange Binance among investors to bail out victims of ...](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-exchange-binance-among-investors-bail-out-victims-615-mln-heist-2022-04-06/#:~:text=Crypto%20exchange%20Binance%20among%20investors,615%20million%20digital%20coin%20theft)). This was a **coordinated bailout by industry players** to restore confidence. Unlike conspiracies, this was openly announced ‚Äì but it shows exchanges sometimes collaborate to backstop hack victims, akin to how banks might jointly support a failing institution to avoid systemic risk.  

The above examples illustrate that **exchange collusion and market manipulation have precedent** ‚Äì ranging from **illicit schemes** (Mt. Gox bots, BitMEX‚Äôs self-dealing) to **transparent rescue efforts** (Binance‚Äôs bailout attempts). In crypto‚Äôs unregulated Wild West, the line between the two can blur. So when observers see a sudden market crash coinciding with an exchange hack, and then see rivals moving funds around, it‚Äôs not surprising that **rumors of foul play** spread. While **hard evidence** of a coordinated Bybit ‚Äúhack crash‚Äù operation is lacking, the crypto community‚Äôs suspicions come from a real place: past incidents have shown that large players *can* move markets and sometimes work together when their interests align (or conversely, secretly exploit their insider edge).

# Conclusion

There is **strong evidence** that the Bybit hack triggered the crypto price crash: a massive loss of funds led to panic withdrawals and a broad sell-off ([Bybit Hack Postmortem](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-08-2025/#:~:text=,the%20realized%20supply%20%E2%80%9Cair%20gap%E2%80%9D)) ([Bybit Hack Postmortem](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-08-2025/#:~:text=led%20to%20panic%20withdrawals%2C%20with,exacerbated%20by%20the%20Bybit%20hack)). There are also **persistent rumors** that some exchanges took coordinated actions (like loaning ETH to Bybit and shorting the market) to manage the crisis to their advantage ([CEXs are under fire on Twitter, accused of coordinated dumping. : r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ixv4t5/cexs_are_under_fire_on_twitter_accused_of/#:~:text=But%20that%27s%20not%20all%2C%20the,price%20between%20yesterday%20and%20today)) ([Ethereum Sinks 17% to $2,300 as Bybit Hack Resolution and Trump Tariffs Trigger Market Selloff - Forex News by FX Leaders](https://www.fxleaders.com/news/2025/02/27/ethereum-sinks-17-to-2300-as-bybit-hack-resolution-and-trump-tariffs-trigger-market-selloff/#:~:text=Paradoxically%2C%20the%20conclusion%20of%20the,partner%20exchanges%20offering%20emergency%20liquidity)). While these **manipulation theories remain unproven**, they are backed by intriguing on-chain data (large transfers to Wintermute before the dump) and echo historical episodes of exchanges covertly influencing markets ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20few%20days%2C,and%20Ethereum%20for%20various%20reasons)) ([Crypto traders blame Wintermute for weekend of liquidations](https://protos.com/crypto-traders-blame-wintermute-for-weekend-of-liquidations/#:~:text=When%20markets%20crash%2C%20traders%20often,profited%20from%20his%20customers%E2%80%99%20liquidations)). Wintermute‚Äôs alleged involvement highlights the murky role of market makers during extreme volatility ‚Äì though Wintermute and Binance both deny any wrongdoing, attributing the crash to normal market forces and macro news ([Binance denies claims of dumping Ethereum and Solana](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-denies-claims-of-dumping-ethereum-and-solana/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([Wintermute Chief Rejects Blame for Crypto's Biggest Crash of 2025 | CCN.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/wintermute-cryptos-biggest-crash-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20Gaevoy%20says,bearing%20down%20on%20the%20market)).

In the end, the **‚Äúrecent Bitcoin and Ethereum price crash‚Äù** appears to be the result of a **perfect storm**: a real security breach at Bybit with immediate market fallout, compounded by **liquidity maneuvers** to contain the damage, all occurring amid a backdrop of edgy news from global leaders. Investors should approach any single explanation with caution. It‚Äôs possible the crash was *primarily organic* ‚Äì panic and macro jitters ‚Äì but it‚Äôs equally possible that behind-the-scenes coordination amplified the drop. As always in crypto, transparency is hard-won: we have to piece together clues from blockchain data, official statements, and community sleuthing. What is clear is that confidence (or lack thereof) plays a huge role. When a major exchange hack strikes or when leaders question financial bedrocks like gold reserves, markets react swiftly and sometimes violently. **Staying informed** (and skeptical) is key.

1i4kgi4,"Borrowing USDT in leverage to lend them Hello I have the feeling I had a good investment idea but I gotta acid test with Reddit.
Let's imagine I have X USD in BTC and I can use it to borrow 5X USDT. Daily interest rate: 0.0283%
Then I can lend those 5X USDT with a minimum APY of 11.58% having a profit of 1.25% or 6.25% which is a good return with limited risk. The only risk is if the BTC loses a lot of its value and I get liquidated. Considering we are in bull run and BTC will grow further, do you think this is a good strategy levering as well the appreciation of BTC to even amplify the gains?

I've been seeing so many posts about XRP since it's price has pumped up quite a lot in the past few days, and you hear about it all over YouTube, but I want to hear it from the actual people, that if you could put your life savings in only XRP or BTC for the next 10 years, locked and unable to cash out before 10 years is full, which would you rather have? Also, there's no 3rd option because you have to choose either XRP or BTC.

We don't really need to have any reasons why, since it's fairly obvious by now to everyone that what the XRP gang and Bitcoiners think of each other, so let's just cast a vote and see the results. I also think that ""10"" years is a fairly fair time horizon, as anything can happen in 1 month or 1 year.

Also, please feel free to send forward this poll so we get more realistic results on the current state of the market hype. I wanna see at least 100k votes by the end of the week!

1gkqal5,"Trip Report: Struggles of a new crypto user Hi all, just want to give an idea of what it‚Äôs like for a new user of cryptocurrency.

Prior to this past month, I have never used crypto before. I however wanted to buy a knife on a game called CSGO in a third party market, so I decided to try out crypto to make my purchase.

I first research where to buy crypto, and find that one of the few available exchanges to me is Gemini.

I make an account, and submit my information and ID to verify. It verifies in 6 hours, which wasn‚Äôt a fun wait but whatever I guess.

I get back on my Gemini account and use my debit card to deposit. Deposit fails about 5 times, and after calling back my bank they finally let me purchase. That process took about an hour to figure out as a newbie. 

I then finally have balance in my Gemini account of $300, and make a purchase of Litecoin as my research told me this has some of the cheapest fees on its network when sending to another Litecoin wallet. 

It tries to only first give me like $280 worth using their autobuy feature, but then I realized you can go on the actual market itself within Gemini and I was able to get $300 for like $295ish. Kind of a trap if I really didnt look any deeper so bad taste in my mouth already from that

I then try to withdraw my Litecoin to the csgo market and I get a warning that my crypto is locked on the platform for ***10 DAYS*** and I cannot withdraw it. 

What the FUCK. At no point leading up to this was it ever mentioned I had to wait this long just to get my own crypto off the exchange.

Thankfully, the value of my Litecoin has gone up a bit since then but if it had fallen I would not have enough money to actually buy what I wanted.

I wait 10 full days and I finally get the chance to send it off to the csgo market and by that point the specific knife pattern I wanted was already gone. 

What a pleasant experience this was. I consider myself relatively tech savvy but this seemed quite complicated of a process with a lot of traps to avoid.

I‚Äôm unsure how the average public would even be able to use this, because my first experience honestly fucking sucked ***when I reallyyyy wanted to enjoy it***

1hcj240,"Is CHEX undervalued compared to ONDO and MANTRA? With the RWA tokenization sector expected to reach up to¬†[30 trillion USD by 2030](https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-tokenization-trillion-dollar-growth-driven-financial-institutions), many financial institutions will likely look to have their own tokenization platform. Using Chintai‚Äôs¬†[MAS licensed](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution/detail/247818-CHINTAI-NETWORK-SERVICES-PTE-LTD), ¬† white-label tech, they can quickly do this, with everything powered by the CHEX utility token, the use of which increases with the number of clients that build their own platforms using Chintai.¬†¬†¬†

I‚Äôve researched Chintai and the CHEX token and here are my reasons why I believe this could be undervalued:

**Strong Client Pipeline**

Four clients ([Kin Cap](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/30/digital-asset-manager-kin-launches-100m-tokenized-real-estate-fund-on-chintai-network/),¬†[DNA Deal Desk,](https://cointelegraph.com/news/venture-firm-dna-launches-desk-tokenized-equity-startups)¬†[Powerdime AI](https://cointelegraph.com/news/power-dime-tokenize-250-m-renewable-energy-assets-chintai)¬†and¬†[Premier Art](https://beincrypto.com/chintai-tokenized-fine-art-fund/)) across a range of sectors) have recently been announced (3 in December alone), with 50+ expected before the end of Q1 2025 and over 2 billion USD set to be tokenized according to the CEO of Chintai. Keeping in mind that this is a fully regulated project with a dedicated team that has been building for years, projections like this are very likely to be accurate. The more clients, the more tokenization occurs, the more the CHEX token is utilized.

**No Tier 1 Listing‚Ä¶.Yet**

Up to this point, there‚Äôs a lack of awareness about CHEX and it's only accessible via DEX (Uniswap, Raydium) and a couple of smaller CEX‚Äôs¬†(MEXC, Gate and Bitfinex). A Tier 1 listing is on the way, according to the team. This is growing more likely, with CHEX now entering the top 200 on CMC. Once that happens, price appreciation should accelerate a great deal.¬†

**Bluechip Tokenomics**¬†

100% fully distributed, fair-launched, and deflationary through the burn mechanism from fees collecting when issuances occur. Through their Chintai Nexus platform, holders will be able to stake and receive CHEX rewards as their clients launch and the fees begin rolling in. For further info on the tokenomics take a look at the road map:¬†[https://chintainexus.com/group/chexroadmap.pdf](https://chintainexus.com/group/chexroadmap.pdf)¬†

**Comparison to Mantra/Ondo**

Besides from marketing, there is no justifiable reason in my opinion why CHEX should be a lower market cap than ONDO or MANTRA. They simply have slick marketing departments. ONDO has tokenized 650 million USD, while CHEX has announced approximately 500 million USD of tokenization in the last month (see client pipeline section above) with over 2 billion expected by end of Q1 2025. If we look at fully diluted market cap the comparison is even starker.¬†Ondo's FDV is 26x greater than CHEX.

Please note these are approximate figures - the prices change constantly.

CHEX Market Cap - 700 million

CHEX Fully Diluted Market Cap - 700 million

Mantra Market Cap - 3.9 billion

Mantra Fully Diluted Market Cap - 7.4 billion

Ondo Market Cap - 2.7 billion

Ondo Fully Diluted Market Cap - 18.8 billion

**KOLs**

Over the last few weeks, more and more twitter KOLs have begun to get on board and momentum is building.

Miles Deutscher -¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrvdn5HOdP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrvdn5HOdP0)

**Conclusion**

CHEX seems to be undervalued compared to other RWA leading projects, when tokenomics and listings are taken into account. They have had a lack of marketing to retail so far, but KOLs are beginning to take notice and interest is growing organically. If the client pipeline is accurate and 50 clients launch before end of Q1 2025, this is extremely positive, with many more announcements to come.

After trying out a few exchanges at the start, I settled for Binance which, at the time, seemed a solid choice, and moved all of my assets onto there.

Well, year after year, it's been spiraling down and now it feels just like traditional banking (or, occasionally, a plain scam/Ponzi scheme): country taxation applied even if I don't realize my gains, a very clunky site/software, cool options been taken away at every new release, annoying trading limits, unnecessary invasions of privacy (asking me to fill in details to comply with local regulations and stuff), etc.

Long story short, I want to migrate to a more basic and free (not in terms of costs/fees, but in terms of not being a corporate scam): any recommendations?

For context:

\-I am in an EU country

\-I don't do day trading, I'm in for the medium-long run: I occasionally, like once a month or if some major shifts happen, do some trading or consolidating, but I mostly just let stuff sit and grow

\-I don't do meme coins or similar stuff

$MAID UPDATE

Those who have been with us from the very start know how hard we have worked to build this project up from an idea to reality.

A LOT of funds were invested as we navigated through pump in an attempt to bond along with forming a community (we have a solid core group now of active members)

We had 2 events which really effected us during the bonding phase

ü™ô Day one - I had grinded for about 18 hours straight and then we had a huge market crash (I believe one of the biggest liquidations in history)

ü™ô Day Three - Again I had put in around 18 hours straight and we were building fantastically well and at around 35k MC. The growth was perfect for me and holder count was rising. I knew by using this method it would instantly do well once bonded. Unfortunately we then had a cabal come in and bond us within the blink of an eye to then dump as soon as it was bonded causing panic selling from other investors and leaving us where we are now. The ones I know of it have been removed from the chat

My vision from the start was to bring the old school community feel to this project (if you have been in it long enough to remember)

Back then it was all about the community (callers and all the types of marketing that are available now were not really a thing)

It was down to hard work and each community member standing up and taking accountability for their own bag. Creating a fantastic environment where people brought their various skill sets to the table whether that be raiding / creating art,memes / VCs / social media content and being as active as possible on the chat while maintaining that healthy real life / crypto life balance (SUPER IMPORTANT) - 

Word of mouth was the best form of marketing. Being proud of the project and getting contacts you know to invest and become a valuable part of the community. It had a domino effect. It stopped player vs player trading and people understood healthy profit taking, respecting the chart and your fellow community members who you can see are working so so hard.

Some had bigger bags, more money than others but it didn't matter. It was all relevant.

That vision has not changed and that is what I want to create here

$MAID is a long term play. It is not a quick get in and get out and if that is not for you and you like your quick wins or rugs & losses more likely then it's best you move on now (in no way do I mean that rudely - It's just not the type of investors suited to this project.

If you want to join and safe a d honest project, are willing to work hard when you have the time and really stand up and be noticed then you are definitely in the right place ‚úîÔ∏è

The narrative will never change. Help $MAID find her $HOOD

However storylines throughout the course of the journey will. I.E valentine's day coming up so focus will be heavily on that. But that is just one chapter in $MAIDS journey. There are many many more chapters after that which will evolve as the project moves forward.

I am not going to talk about specific marketing strategies in terms of how funds will be utilised. Questions of when marketing or we need trending/ads/callers will fall on death ears. It will come when least expected.

$MAID is strong willed and can overcome any obstacle and we will prevail.

Sorry for the long read all. 

I hope you stick around join us on this journey. More updates to come so watch this space....

**Floki Burning mechanism**

According to Floki burning tracker at [https://www.crypteye.io/burntracker/coins/floki](https://www.crypteye.io/burntracker/coins/floki), Floki current circulating Supply is 4,121,655,181,564.94 (4 trillion), previously its total supply was 10,000,000,000,000 (10 trillion) and has been burned by 58.783% or 5,878,344,818,435.06 (approx. 5,8 trillion). If we are looking onto the picture above, approx. 101,710,814,435.90 (101 billion) token worth of $18,432,033.79 has been burnt in the past year. One of the method to burn the token is to simply through address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead at BNB network.

If we compare Floki burn rate and Shiba burn rate, you can see that Shiba burn in slower rate (58.783% of Floki total supply vs 41.0495 % of Shiba total supply. But, we still has to take into account that Shiba inu total supply is much higher compared to Floki's (100 trillion vs 10 trillion), so it will take much time and money to burn shiba's token. Holders should still feels exciting to see how much token will be burned in the next 2 to 5 years, especially there is a chance that 2025 token burn rate will be higher than 2024 with the launching of Valhalla game.

**Valhalla game**

Based on Floki whitepaper at [https://docs.floki.com/floki-whitepaper/master/the-valhalla-nft-metaverse-game](https://docs.floki.com/floki-whitepaper/master/the-valhalla-nft-metaverse-game), Valhalla is NFT metaverse game that aim to burn more Floki token as it using Floki as the in-game currency. Valhalla launch in Q1 2025 with its treasury of almost $60 million. So, we will see how effective this game in order to help reducing Floki Token. The more people play this game, the easier will be in reducing Floki circulating supply token.

**Comparing Valhalla** **to Shiba eternity, Shiba inu's game**

Based on [https://mmostats.com/game/shiba-eternity](https://mmostats.com/game/shiba-eternity), Shiba eternity has total players of 27,9 thousand and the players that play actively are 1,3k. I think this number is pretty great, especially it has been more than 2 years since the game launched and still has lot of fanbases. Also, if you see on the picture below, the total download of the app is more than 100k.

Iif we make comparison, Shiba Inu in general is more famous than Floki, with Shiba ranked at 16 while Floki at 78, based on Coingecko. But we have to take into account that the popularity of open world game is more than trading card game. So, in this department, Valhalla is still has an edge. In the end, if we estimate that Valhalla has similiar of total players or the active daily players as well as total download of the game app the same as Shiba eternity, it would be really bullish for Floki as the token burning process will be a lot faster than now. If this scenario comes true, we will see more pump for Floki in 2025, tho, I cant say that whether it can replicate its achievement in 2024 that pump by more than 400% over the year. Still, even if its pumped by 100% in 2025, its still a big achievement.",0

I was thinking of bridging the chain, but I do not want to take any additional risks. Is there a scenario where wstETH goes to 0 at BNB Smart Chain while staying at its true value on Ethereum and the other chains?

Reasoning is, that there is only one third party bridge (Wormhole) offering off- and onramp to BNB Smart Chain of wstETH.",1

1h3323m,"BTCTKVR: Privacy Magazine Makes Crypto Cypherpunk Again As cryptocurrency adoption grows, the cypherpunk spirit appears to be fading. The crypto anarchists who started it all often find themselves outnumbered and have their voices drowned out by misguided speculators who are more than willing to surrender their privacy and sovereignty in exchange for some price pumps. 

However, these cypherpunk principles are much more than an expression of OG sentiments ‚Äî they are a return to first principles and the initial social contract which turned Bitcoin into an unstoppable global phenomenon.

This groundbreaking magazine, open sourced and made available to the entire world today, comprises 154 pages of expert insights and practical guides. The entire content is available freely under the Creative Commons Zero license ‚Äì which means that you can read, copy, modify, translate, print, and even sell without asking for permission.

The goal is to spread information about financial privacy all around the world, through the power of open source knowledge!

BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition includes 32 contributions from 30 different authors, and covers the privacy features of popular cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, Zano, Litecoin, Alephium, Nym, Beam, and Firo.

Exploring the Depths of Privacy:
The magazine features an array of articles:‚Ä¢ Bitcoin Privacy: Articles explore the technical limitations of Bitcoin privacy, how they are supplemented with CoinJoin technology, and why setting up BTCPay Server and Wasabi Wallet might be a good idea.

‚Ä¢ Monero Privacy: Two excellent articles, written by community members Untraceable and Tuxsudo, explain the technical and philosophical intricacies of the world‚Äôs leading privacy coin.

‚Ä¢ Litecoin Privacy: Thanks to the addition of MWEB (Mimble Wimble Extension Block), Litecoin is now the most liquid and widely-adopted privacy coin. Read the article by Chris on Crypto to understand how it works.

‚Ä¢ Zcash & Firo: Insights into zero-knowledge proofs and their implications for user privacy. The most avant-garde of privacy cryptocurrencies get their moment in the spotlight, with three excellent dedicated articles.

‚Ä¢ Zano & Beam: The future of DeFi looks promising, with confidential assets that user can transfer without revealing any public information about amounts or the parties involved. Think about the limitless potential of building private internet companies, which issue shares and pay dividends without letting any outsiders know.

‚Ä¢ BTCPay Setup: A step-by-step setup guide for BTCPay Server, written by anml_litecoin, will teach you how to receive payments with maximum privacy.

Philosophical Underpinnings:
Beyond the technical considerations, BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition highlights the philosophical necessity of financial privacy in a digital world. The magazine posits that privacy is not just a feature but a fundamental right that‚Äôs crucial for the protection of individual freedoms.

A Broad, Non-Tribal Perspective:
The publication includes contributions from:‚Ä¢ Josh Swihart, CEO of Electric Coin Company, who offers unique insights into the future of Zcash.‚Ä¢ Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of Starkware, who explains the scalability and privacy benefits of ZK STARKs.‚Ä¢ Naomi Brockwell and Joel Valenzuela, known for their advocacy in privacy and freedom of transactions.‚Ä¢ Most notably, the magazine features the works of grassroots cypherpunks, bringing fresh perspectives to the privacy discourse.

A Unique Visual Experience:
Illustrations by Annie bring a unique flavor to the magazine, with Pepe the Frog leading readers through the articles in a comic book style. This artistic choice aims to make the topic of privacy more approachable, using humor and satire to engage readers at multiple levels.

Launch and Distribution:
BTCTKVR: Privacy Edition was officially unveiled at MoneroTopia on November 16th 2024, where the initial batch of 100 physical copies was distributed. The magazine is now accessible globally online, so anyone can read it without any barriers.

Call to Action:
This publication isn't just about sharing knowledge; it's a call to action for cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide to understand and use privacy techniques. Blockchains were made to liberate us from central control, not to create panopticons for governments and corporations. So the more people learn how to protect their financial privacy, the faster the world achieves liberation via freedom of transactions.

Availability:
‚Ä¢ Digital Copy: Available for free download at https://bitcoin-takeover.com/privacymag‚Ä¢ Physical Copy: While some copies will get printed for privacy-related events (MoneroTopia, MoneroKon), everyone is encouraged to print their own magazines in order to spread the knowledge. But if you really want to order a print, you can send an e-mail.‚Ä¢ Print your own magazine: https://github.com/VladdyC/privacymag

About BTCTKVR:
The BTCTKVR project started out with the Bitcoin Takeover podcast (February 2019 - Present) and the BTCKVR magazines (July 2021 - Present) ‚Äî as hosted, designed, and coordinated by Vlad Costea. It aims to provide information to people who genuinely want to use the power of Bitcoin to improve the world beyond the memes and hopium-infused narratives.

1is5h7y,"Diving into the Liquidity Pool: Week 40 **Current state of the pool & the last week of trading**

Total Value locked in [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com/) is $ 20.91k

* 2.31151 ETH
* 6615570 DONUT
* Trading Volume in last 24 hours = **$** **3.14k**
* Trading Volume in last 7 days = **$ 6.35k**
* In the last 7 days ETH is has moved - 0.1 **%**
* In the last 7 days DONUT has moved -12.4 **%**
* Last week 1 ETH = **1.08m DONUT**
* Today 1 ETH = **1.21m DONUT**
* **4852.24** **DONUT** per day distributed amongst all in range positions.

A few notable movements this in the last week; initially one wallet purchased about 1k worth of DONUT, which saw DONUT return to $0.003 and pushed the ratio of 1 ETH to 921k DONUT.

This held until yesterday, where Mainnet whales sold off a significant amount (20k volume total in last 24 hours), creating a domino affect into Arbitrum - where donut was sold off again. This saw the ratio drop as low as 1 ETH buying 1.32M DONUT.

Additional buys have then seen the current ratio rest at 1 ETH with the purchasing power for 1.21M DONUT.

Recent contest rewards have been distributed, and now we await R147 contribution rewards to be processed.

With the new round of 147, a new season of Special Membership has also begun, which currently costs 4270 DONUT - for those buying the special membership, this helps reduce the overall potential sell pressure.
