1hwg4f4,"What Did 2024 Teach You About Crypto? Reflecting on the year 2024, It was groundbreaking for the crypto space, filled with milestones and innovations that reshaped the industry. Bitcoin reached an all-time high, reaffirming its dominance, while altcoins like SOL, BNB, BGB, and XRP also soared, delivering substantial gains. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs, the expansion of layer-2 solutions, and the adoption of DeFi protocols demonstrated the immense potential of blockchain technology, the seamless integration of AI into web3. These advancements brought crypto closer to mainstream adoption, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems.  Memecoins also had their moments, with coins like PNUT, FARTCOIN, CHILLGUY all delivering substantial gains, drawing in both thrill-seekers and skeptics. While some made fortunes, others faced harsh realities, I've had share of both haha.  Personally, trading memecoins taught me a valuable lesson, if you're greedy, you will get rug pulled majority of the time, you need to be disciplined. Beyond the market, 2024 emphasized the importance of education, security, and patience. It was a year of growth and learning, one that set the stage for even greater opportunities in 2025.  What coin gave you the most profit last year? What valuable lesson did you learn in 2024?",1

1hixqqe,"Strategy with alts down by a lot I got hit by the FOMO in 2021 and entered the crypto market buying some ADA and DOT (on top of BTC and ETH) near the top, hoping the would keep going up. No stop losses of any sort, low and behold the bear market comes and they go down 80%.While I managed to DCA on BTC and ETH, I just kept my DOT and ADA lying there waiting for them to recover and at least go back to break even before selling. Of course I'm still down by >50%.I'm now realising this is probably not the best strategy and trying to understand what's the best course of action (and the rationale behind it) in such a case. Does it make sense to eat the loss without trying to time the market and trade to BTC? Keep them and wait for altseason to come? Try to sell high even if not at at break even and eat a partial loss?I'm trying to be a bit more strategic with my new buys but tbh I'm a bit lost with this.(Small amounts so it's more for the learning than the actual financial implications)",0
1hqu2ta,"Kendu and Ingex: two projects to look out for in 2025 and why  I’ll try and keep this as short and sweet as possible as I know a lot of us are on holidays.

Starting with Kendu, I’ve been part of the community for a while, and it’s beginning to look like one of those projects where the chart hasn’t quite caught up to the fundamentals yet. It’s got *a lot* on the roadmap for 2025 but the two biggest things, in my opinion, is the Solana bridge and upcoming launch of the Chads Marketplace. The bridge is particularly a big deal because for better or worse most of the activity is on Solana these days, and making Kendu available on it will open up a market that it hasn’t previously been able to tap into. This is not investment advice, but it might be a good idea to pick up the token on Ethereum now rather than waiting for launch, because the price will essentially mirror the price on Solana when that happens. As for the Chads Marketplace, it will be an NFT platform similar to OpenSea, and will further help Kendu stand out from the vast majority of the projects in the space by having actual utility. These sort of things are what I meant by the chart not quite catching up to the fundamentals. 

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu

Moving on to Ingex. It’s a zk-oracle project that I’m a part of that will generate a revenue share for token holders when the mainnet version launches next year. I’ve been posting regular updates about the project for months. There is a brief background about the project and how we're partnering with memecoins [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/lemond4455/comments/1fyecn4/a_breakdown_of_the_revenue_model_for_ingex/). Our first NFT set, which are the revenue-bearing tokens I was referring to, recently [sold out](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex/overview) and our final ever set has just gone live. There will also be a small allocation on the Chads Marketplace when it launches, but it’s part of the same set. 

**To celebrate the new year, we will also be rewarding the next 8 holders with a distribution of our ERC-20 token (set to launch in Q1). It will be proptional the number of NFTs obtained. Once all 8 slots have been allocated, I will update this thread to reflect that.**

The set, which just went live, is available on the folowing networks (they are identical other than the gas fee to mint):

**[Ethereum](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-standard-eth/overview)**

**[Base (lower gas fee)](https://opensea.io/collection/ingex-standard-base/overview)**

1h25xdb,"What awaits Crypto in 2025 Hello guys! I made a list of events that await us (crypto) in 2025. Here we go;

* Donald Trump takes office: He might be the most pro crypto president in the whole world. He will get into the office in January. Let's see if he is going to keep his promises on Crypto. 
* Gary is getting fired: Gary Gensler, the current head of the SEC who is known for his anti crypto stance, is going to get fired when Trump take the office. It is expected that someone very crypto friendly will replace him which is good for crypto.
* FED is expected to cut rates even more in early months of 2025. This may have positive effects on market in the long term.
* Possible end of conflicts between Russia, Ukraine, Palestine and Israel: Trump is quite serious on ending the wars between Russian and Ukraine. He also wants to bring peace in the middle east. This may impact market positively. 
* Trump's tariff war against China: Unfortunately this may result in higher inflation and could impact market negatively.
* Strict economic policies: Elon Musk said that Trump and himself will have stricter economic policies. He stated that this strict policy may be a bit difficult for the American people at first, but that America will become more comfortable economically in the future. This may impact markets negatively in the near future.

Those are some of the event awaits us in 2025. Some of them are positive, some are negative. Let's see how markets will reacts to those event.

How do you think those event will effect the crypto market?

1hmqs3u,"If you're in the EU, you have until 1.1.2025 before stricter mica regulation will be in place. How do you prepare?  
Especially rules for self hosted wallets are concerning for me. For those who missed it: in an attempt to make crypto more ""transparent"", transfers from self-hosted wallets to custodial wallets or services such as exchanges may require disclosure of sender and recipient information. This is especially true for transactions over a set threshold of 1000 EUR.

This poses risks for us crypto users: Wallet addresses linked to exchanges or large transactions could become identifiable through mandatory KYC policies. Kyc and leaked phone numbers have been one of the worst aspects of crypto in the past years. To Imagine that now these information are linked to your crypto wallets is a nightmare.

If exchanges are forced to record your self hosted wallets, how do you prepare for that? 

1. Set up one specific public address or wallets for transfers to and from exchanges and others for other purposes?

2. Use decentralised exchanges? Which ones? How long until these are monitored as well? 

3. Use mixers or other services to obscure your wallets? Even though I'm concerned these services would make your transactions look more suspicious instead of less. 

4. Use monero for anonymous transactions? Oh well, if exchanges hadn't removed these already for us in preparation.

5. Switch your usdt, dai and other no longer supported stable coins to USDC (edit: added)

Oh man, how much I hate these kind of regulation... What are your thoughts?",1

1iww2lv,"Arbitrum DAO's Latest Proposal: Good for Ethereum, But Could It Be Better? Just crossed with this Arbitrum [Tweet](https://x.com/arbitrumgovbot/status/1893081530060214505) that shares one of the latest proposal from Arbitrum DAO and I believe that its a good move for Ethereum L1 but I also think that it could be better. Maybe you don't know but the DAO approved the formation of two different committees, the treasury management Committee (TMC) and the Growth Management Committee (GMC). This last one, the GMC, has proposed an strategy to deploy 7,500 ETH for yield generation and ecosystem growth in the following way:

* **Lido - 5,000 ETH**
* **Aave V3 - 5,000 wstETH**
* **Fluid - 2,500 ETH**

As you may first think you will say, okay its fine no problem at all, and in fact this is ""bullish"" for ETH because this move will increase ETH staking adoption, improving the network security while getting yields. More staking also means reduced circulating supply and increase in ETH long term stability. However, not everything is great. As you know Arbitrum is a L2s project and it also has Arbitrum native projects like Camelot for example. I think they should have proposed at least supporting one or a few Arbitrum native projects to also support their own chain dApps...

The snapshot vote is set for February 27, 2025 and it requires a simple majority and 3% quorum. Let see what community decides regarding this last governance that probably will be controversial.

What do you all think?

1igh3uh,"Over $2 billion in crypto were liquidated in the last 12 hours In the past 24 hours, over 700,000 traders were liquidated across multiple exchanges, with the total liquidations amounting to an incredible $2.19 billion. This marks one of the most significant events in recent trading history, highlighting the volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in the crypto market.

Interestingly, $2.03 billion of this total was liquidated within just the last 12 hours, emphasizing the sharp and rapid market movements. Even more surprising, $1.2 billion of these liquidations occurred in the final 4 hours of the 24-hour period, demonstrating the extreme nature of these market dynamics.

The largest single liquidation order was placed on Binance, involving the ETHBTC trading pair, with a jaw-dropping value of $25.64M.

1ivxztb,"Another Major Pattern Broken: For the first time in history, the price of Bitcoin did not double after 4 exactly years! For the first time in Bitcoin's history, its price did not double after exactly 4 years. 

This has been a pattern that many of us have been following closely in hopes that it would continue, but as of this week, it is no more. February 22nd of 2021, Bitcoin was trading at $50k. Today we're at $96k

It seems like every bullish pattern in Bitcoin's price history is eventually broken. I started buying in June of 2021 and I have seen several. 

Also, it seems like bearish patterns keep getting broken as well, but to the downside. I remember back in Oct/Nov of 2022 how everyone said that Bitcoin could not drop below $20k due to a strong pattern and it ended up dropping to $16k. 

Long story short, all models continue to be broken. Can't rely on anything with Bitcoin. Just got to hold and ride it out. It seems like diminishing returns are here to stay. 

The only consolation for me is that over these 4 years, it has outperformed the SP500 which is what I'd be holding if not Bitcoin.

Today as you already know we got Powell speech and rate decision and some of us expected this to keep going up if the rates were reduced as expected which it happened. However it acted like a sell the news event due to CPI data being high and the previous one high too. Also PPI was surprisingly higher than expected + other data.

Market basically didn't liked Powell decision and also him saying that 2% goal will reach in 1-2 years (big lie) because market cycles are sacred and in 2026 we will be like in 2022. This basically sent a message saying that probably Powell will not be able to reduce it more than 4% making it a bearish for the long term.

This is why I believe the market dumped + other uncertainties like Turkey-Kurds tension, etc.

Anyway, as always market provides new opportunities to buy cheaper and make money. Let see what happens in the coming months. I still expect 2025 to be a great year and don't let be eaten by panic. Always zoom out.

1h6clup,"Exploring ZKSync - $ZK ready to break out G'day from the upside down - it's your neighborhood ZK Bull reporting in.  


All year I have maintained my stance that ZKSync will be the top ZKRollup, and as ZK's, whhich are a newer technology, continue to develop, will catch up to the older optimistic rollups.  I eventually anticipate the top3 networks will be Arbitrum, Base and ZKSync.  


ZK Sync is now worth more than it's starting airdrop value!  


Released on July 30th,  $ZK started at an initial value of $0.214 - and as to be expected, dipped after the airdrop. ZK has been performing well the last few days, returning to that value, but now it looks ready to break out, as it as teased prices at 22 to 23 cents.  


Currently ZK sits at rank #154 and with a price of  $0.2336   


How much higher will it go?

ZK continues to grow in TVL, alongside Starknet - both have recently flipped Linea according to l2beat. It won't be long before ZK flips BLAST next, and eventually next year, really start to close to gap between those top 3 Optimistic rollups.

# 

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has finally cut interest rates by 0.25% last week to 4.10%. This comes after they have held interest rates unchanged for more than a year at 4.35% (last rate hike was in November 2023 as shown by the brown line above).

The reason for the rate cut was lower inflationary pressures in Australia, but the meeting statement said that policymakers want to be careful future rate cuts as it may derail disinflation. After the meeting, Governor Bullock said the next move will be based on data and this rate cut is not a signal that they will start a series of cuts.

Meanwhile the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut rate by 0.50%, bringing their Cash Rate to 3.75%, the third 0.50% rate cut since October 2024 as shown by the grey line in the chart above. As you can see the RBNZ peak policy rate was much higher than the RBA peak policy rate, but their swift cuts have already brought their policy rate below the RBAs.

# Global Monetary Policy Still Tight

Despite the smaller size and market impact of the RBA and RBNZ, it's good to see more interest rate cuts from central banks. However, when looking at the bigger picture, interest rates still remain very high as you can see below:

https://preview.redd.it/clrr8v0bstke1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa9e8e2682d7128424a845cf54b6353be42cfac6

Despite all global central banks cutting rates (excluding Bank of Japan of course, who are hiking), the level of interest rates are still high.

# Top Three Main Central Banks Look Likely to Pause

The Federal Reserve members have turned somewhat hawkish and are signalling a pause following higher inflation readings and data that shows the labour market is still strong. ECB policymaker Schnabel said last week that they are getting close to a rate pause as their policy may not be restrictive anymore and high energy prices are a risk. Meanwhile a higher inflation reading from UK last week at 3.0% versus forecast 2.8% casts doubt that inflation may still be on the decline, which could limit scope for the Bank of England to cut rates further. Adding to more uncertainty is Trump’s tariff policies, which have the potential to increase inflationary pressures.

# Final Thoughts

When central banks started easing in mid to late 2024, it was seen as a good signal to support the crypto bull run and altseason, but seeing how shallow the rate cuts have been, if there are no other new catalysts such as more favourable regulatory developments from US and the SEC, it is possible that the big pump will be delayed further. This means it is even more important to continue monitoring economic data and central bank statements in the coming weeks and months, especially inflation and employment data.

1gq3ksk,"Fees associated with selling and withdrawing As we are all holding down the fort as this bull market continues and it’s been a long time since I sold anything,  I might have to take profits at some point. Because of this, I thought it would be helpful for others/ new people and wanted to inquire on all of the fees associated with selling. From what I know, there is a fee associated with:

-selling eth
-converting eth to usd
-withdrawing usd to a bank

What are the cheapest and most reputable places to do these transactions?

From what I’ve seen Kraken has some of the lowest fees. But I’m not familiar with the fees on withdrawing usd to a bank. I’ve also seen reviews about using coinbase pro or coinbase advanced. I have used Binance before which has low fees but you are unable to withdraw usd currently. 

It seems most of the fees are based on trading volume. Would it make sense to sell a portion of what you have initially to get that lower fee percentage and then sell the rest?

Another question I thought of is would it be better to do all of the transactions in one exchange? For example, Binance might have the lowest fees but you are unable to withdraw with usd, you would have to then send it to another exchange where you would have to incur another fee. ",2

1i8278t,"Bitcoin trading strategy - sell high buy lower Hi all,

A simple plan - let say,  if BTC is around 105-108K, and therefore is close to break again fresh ATM, I'm looking to apply a simple strategy:

\- goal: with all BTC I hold, try to sell high when its such a high range.

\- goal: try to buy back minimum 5% more BTC I had before selling it. Ideally 10% or more if possible if such a dip.

\- no leverage trading, just simple selling and buying BTC you have

\- waiting time to buy back for me personally is irrelevant. I'm anymway holding all BTC very long term, year 2030+. So why not to try to let say: double the amount of BTC holding right now with this strategy.

\- obvious risk - I can sell at some future point, and BTC may never drop again back to my desired level - Let say I sold at 108K and had a buy order at 102K but BTC never dropped to this point in next months/year. For this situation there's Plan B: to buy back at higher level up to max 108K level at where I sold it. Plan C: if BTC really shoots up so much from my original sold price, and many months/1 year waiting time passed, then be happy with what I got so far, no regrets, and move on to pick some of the TOP20 crypto for buy and long term hold opportunity. Adjust strategy back to BTC in years to come if price drops. Additionally: during waiting time, as months can pass, put the USDC I got for my BTC selling into some of the exchanges/platform to earn interest in Flexi mode, not fixed term, so I can immediately buy back BTC

\- plan is probably not to sell immediately after each new ATH level, but using price alerts, then actively monitor the market and chart developments to see and try to decide if the price has the potential to rally more, so then to postpone the sell based on market conditions but be able to act quickly if you decide to sell

\- I could just set sell/buy orders, but I like more to monitor the price action and then to act live

\- this is still rough draft plan. Need to refine things.

Which tools would you use to decide at which high price points you'd sell?

The main point here, is a decision to not have regrets if Plan C. I own my BTC since 7K-30K levels and made profits.



Any resources or personal suggestions which can improve this strategy? Thanks a lot",0

1hj4s0q,"Cramer Says Buy The crypto Dip. More Pains Ahead? Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" and a former hedge fund manager, is at it again, this time advising investors to ""buy the crypto dip."" 

https://preview.redd.it/ptf407drk58e1.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f25b2a5623df91fd8be363ea076e5f0515a4da0

But here's the thing with Cramer - his advice often leads to the opposite happening, a phenomenon hilariously dubbed the ""Inverse Cramer Effect.""

Let's talk about Ethereum (ETH). Back in March this year, Cramer expressed belief that a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) [“will soon bloom.” ](https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-money-host-jim-cramer-expects-spot-ethereum-etf-to-bloom-soon/)

When the ETFs were eventually approved 3 months later, they turned out to be nothing short of a disappointment and have been struggling to impress ever since.

Fast forward to 6 months ago, Cramer [endorsed ETH as a great store of value](https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-endorses-ether-as-great-store-of-value-amid-us-dollar-concerns/) amid US Dollar Concerns. Has ETH been living up to that endorsement? It's like the crypto market loves to prove him wrong. 

But it's not just ETH; the wider crypto market seems to have its own dance moves when Cramer speaks. Early this year in January, Cramer said “Unlikely that Bitcoin finds its footing.” BTC was $39,556 at the time. It went on to skyrocket to $108k, more than 155% gain, ushering a wider market rally. 

https://preview.redd.it/c2fwujxwk58e1.jpg?width=1187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c488801864699c6ca2cafab1d783b7bc751dbb9

Now, with Cramer saying ""buy the dip,"" you've got to wonder - is this the signal for more pains ahead? So, if you're thinking about diving into the dip, maybe take a moment to consider the Inverse Cramer Effect.",0

For the past years I was long on Solana, BTC and ETH without even looking at it. Unfortunately ETH was not doing good so I switched on alt coin by diversifying and buying only coins that was on strong buy makers on Tradingview. That didnt works as it makes me buy some coins that already explosed and I began to lose money. Then for the past 2 weeks I was full liquid waiting the big dip that will probably come. Then I tried to put a  following order of 5% (order that follow up and sell when down) but I lost money because of the high volatility as it sold at -5% just before pump. 
Then I tried to sell asap with market order as soon as it was going down fast and then I missed all the fast after pumps

I get so frustrated to lose all this potential gains I then invested all 4 days ago without any stop loss

18% ETH
17% BTC
14% GRT
12% ADA
10% DOT
8% BCH
6% ATOM
6% UNI
4% ETC
4% SHIBA

I lost 15% yesterday and it is emotionally very painful as I just needed to be little bit more patient.
During the last 30 days of this very bullish market I made until now only +2% with a lot of stress

I didnt sold any line despite a big tentation and I am unfortunately fully invested… if not I would renforce now….

In hindsight, a time-lock could have prevented that, so I’m exploring options now to avoid making the same mistake in the future.

1hr90p2,"2024 was good ear for BTC, here’s thread from Grok: In 2024, Bitcoin adoption saw notable growth, influenced by several key events and developments. Here's a comprehensive overview:  
Key Events and Developments:

* January 10, 2024: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This event was pivotal in opening Bitcoin investment to a broader audience, particularly institutional investors, by allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency.
* April 19, 2024: Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving, an event programmed to occur approximately every four years, reducing the reward for mining new blocks from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins. This halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, historically leading to price increases due to the supply-demand dynamic. It also marked the launch of the Runes Protocol and the reintroduction of OP\_CAT on Signet, further enhancing Bitcoin's functionality and attractiveness.
* Throughout the Year: Bitcoin's price hit multiple all-time highs, with a significant peak at $73,000 in March. This was partly driven by the anticipation of the halving, ETF approvals, and increasing institutional interest.
* Adoption Trends: Global adoption rates were particularly high in developing countries, with regions like Latin America, Africa, and Asia showing significant growth. Bitcoin reached an adoption rate of about 4.7% of the global population by May 2024, paralleling early Internet adoption rates.
* Institutional and Government Involvement:
   * El Salvador continued its pioneering role by surpassing 6,000 BTC in its national holdings by the end of 2024, demonstrating a state-level adoption of Bitcoin.
   * US Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $35.66 billion in inflows throughout the year, with BlackRock leading the charge. Retail investors were responsible for a significant portion of this demand.
   * Regulatory Actions: There was a shift towards more crypto-friendly policies, with the U.S. House of Representatives passing resolutions to support digital asset custodians, although met with a presidential veto. This suggests a mixed but increasingly positive regulatory environment.
* Bitcoin as a Store of Value: The narrative of Bitcoin as 'digital gold' strengthened, with its scarcity becoming more pronounced after the halving, attracting more investors looking for a hedge against inflation and economic instability.
* Market Performance: Bitcoin's market performance was robust, with net inflows through ETFs averaging significant amounts daily, contributing to a market cap increase. Bitcoin also reached and surpassed the $100,000 mark, indicating strong investor confidence.
* Technological and Ecosystem Developments:
   * The introduction of new protocols like Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens allowed for novel use cases, including the creation of NFTs on Bitcoin's blockchain, which could drive further adoption.
   * Innovations like the Runes Protocol and the reintroduction of OP\_CAT on Signet are indicative of ongoing development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, potentially attracting more developers and users.

Overall, 2024 was a transformative year for Bitcoin, marked by regulatory advancements, technological innovations, and significant market events that collectively pushed Bitcoin towards mainstream financial acceptance.",0
1ghnitv,"Jupiter’s Mission and Meow’s Vission  PS: This is my first time creating a lengthy thread for I don’t know what reason. Please bear with me… please don’t flame me…. 😄

Hello, beloved Founders, Team/Moderators, Cats working groups, LFG Candidates, Catdets and Of course the ZER0B0IS of Jupiverse and you anons who might be joining us soon! I’m Br0x, a wanderer who found a home here as a proud zer0boi/catdet, and I love to larp in unexpected ways. 😸 

Today, I want to share some thoughts on Meow’s vision for JUP, the ethos that drives us, and how we can all bring this vision to life through PPP in the world of Jupiverse.

Jupiter’s Ethos: Continuous Growth and Active Participation

At the heart of Jupiter’s ethos is a commitment to continuous development, unlimited iterations, and an active, engaged community. This means we’re always evolving, learning, and welcoming new ideas that push us forward. While each catdet and community member enjoys having fun, staying curious, and helping others, we’re also here to make a real impact. With every action, we’re shaping the future of the Jupiverse together.

The Role of PPP in the Jupiverse

Player Pumps Player (PPP) is crucial to our ethos because it creates an environment of mutual support and trust. When trust thrives, we’re able to move beyond competition (PvP) to true collaboration. PPP is more than just a philosophy. It’s a framework that guides us in building a cohesive community where everyone’s contributions are amplified by the support of others.

With the right mechanisms, communication, and safeguards, PPP transforms the Jupiverse into a place where each member’s success fuels the growth of the whole. We’re building a highly collaborative community, working together toward a decentralized meta. This shared purpose makes the journey rewarding.

The Meaning Behind Jupuary

Jupuary is more than just a name; it’s an embodiment of Jupiter’s values. Inspired by JUP CATS PIE, introduced by Meow in his Genesis post, Jupuary reminds us that every member deserves the same nurturing care as a well. A loved cat. Meow got inspired by a cat being fed, groomed, and cared for. Meow envisions JUP’s governance in the same way, where everyone in the Jupiverse feels supported, valued, and at home.

Jupuary is our time to reflect, engage, and contribute to the growth of the Jupiverse, embracing JUP ethos of continuous improvement.

Growing the Meta: Empowering Every Member

One of the core principles of Meow’s vision is to Grow the meta. Extending our reach, strengthening our influence, and empowering every community member. The recent DAO initiatives and grants to contributors like Jussy and Fabiano (shoutout to my brothers!) reflect this ethos in action. Together, we’re building the Jupiverse as a force within the crypto landscape, bringing everyone’s strengths together to shape something bigger.

Looking Forward: Why Jupuary and PPP Matter

For me, Jupuary is a time to reflect on JUP’s growth and future. Reading through Meow’s vision and seeing our PPP mindset in action has shown me how we’re each a part of a larger story. Jupuary is our chance to be more than passive members; it’s a call to embody PPP, support one another, and actively shape the Jupiverse.

I shared some early thoughts in my Jupuary Insight, where you can check out more of my journey. I’m just starting. https://x.com/zxc0xbr_/status/1851642555940913508?s=46

Growth is inevitable. 

Growth is inevitable, but it won’t happen without each of us pitching in. If you’re reading this and you’re already an active member, you’re part of this movement. The Jupiverse is expanding every day, and every action we take big or small it strengthens Jupiverse. If you believe in JUP’s potential, I encourage you to share your ideas, help onboard new members, and contribute in any way you can.

Together, ZER0B0I and CATDETS continue to grow the Jupiverse, live out Jupiter’s ethos, and make PPP our core strength.

1ibknhg,"Cryptocurrencies **I don't think Bitcoin deserves all this hype. It's true that it's the first currency and we thank Satoshi or whoever for this idea, as it has made it possible and opened the way for other companies with real projects to create their own currencies. Also, stock companies may also create currencies, and this is the real investment to put your money in and buy their own digital currency. But Bitcoin has no project, even in terms of transfer. It is slow and takes a large commission. There are currencies with real projects that are fast in transferring money, such as Solna Trax, and there are many others. Their commission when transferring is less and faster. That's why I don't like Bitcoin and don't invest in it. It is also inflated. I don't think it will rise many times over. There are other currencies whose market value is small and they have a great chance to rise many times over. They also have real projects and can be transferred quickly and with a lower commission. It is much better than Ethereum and Bitcoin.**



**And don't compare gold to Bitcoin. Gold is gold, tangible and mined, but Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Other currencies can be created in the same way and mined as well. But the most important thing about currencies is that they have real projects and can be transferred from one person to another quickly and with the lowest commission. There are many cryptocurrencies that excel in this. About Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it has the opportunity to achieve large profits, unlike the inflated Bitcoin**

$MAID UPDATE

Those who have been with us from the very start know how hard we have worked to build this project up from an idea to reality.

A LOT of funds were invested as we navigated through pump in an attempt to bond along with forming a community (we have a solid core group now of active members)

We had 2 events which really effected us during the bonding phase

🪙 Day one - I had grinded for about 18 hours straight and then we had a huge market crash (I believe one of the biggest liquidations in history)

🪙 Day Three - Again I had put in around 18 hours straight and we were building fantastically well and at around 35k MC. The growth was perfect for me and holder count was rising. I knew by using this method it would instantly do well once bonded. Unfortunately we then had a cabal come in and bond us within the blink of an eye to then dump as soon as it was bonded causing panic selling from other investors and leaving us where we are now. The ones I know of it have been removed from the chat

My vision from the start was to bring the old school community feel to this project (if you have been in it long enough to remember)

Back then it was all about the community (callers and all the types of marketing that are available now were not really a thing)

It was down to hard work and each community member standing up and taking accountability for their own bag. Creating a fantastic environment where people brought their various skill sets to the table whether that be raiding / creating art,memes / VCs / social media content and being as active as possible on the chat while maintaining that healthy real life / crypto life balance (SUPER IMPORTANT) - 

Word of mouth was the best form of marketing. Being proud of the project and getting contacts you know to invest and become a valuable part of the community. It had a domino effect. It stopped player vs player trading and people understood healthy profit taking, respecting the chart and your fellow community members who you can see are working so so hard.

Some had bigger bags, more money than others but it didn't matter. It was all relevant.

That vision has not changed and that is what I want to create here

$MAID is a long term play. It is not a quick get in and get out and if that is not for you and you like your quick wins or rugs & losses more likely then it's best you move on now (in no way do I mean that rudely - It's just not the type of investors suited to this project.

If you want to join and safe a d honest project, are willing to work hard when you have the time and really stand up and be noticed then you are definitely in the right place ✔️

The narrative will never change. Help $MAID find her $HOOD

However storylines throughout the course of the journey will. I.E valentine's day coming up so focus will be heavily on that. But that is just one chapter in $MAIDS journey. There are many many more chapters after that which will evolve as the project moves forward.

I am not going to talk about specific marketing strategies in terms of how funds will be utilised. Questions of when marketing or we need trending/ads/callers will fall on death ears. It will come when least expected.

$MAID is strong willed and can overcome any obstacle and we will prevail.

Sorry for the long read all. 

I hope you stick around join us on this journey. More updates to come so watch this space....

1idl3sn,"Question - Are memecoins not just collectibles? I feel like I should know more about crypto, but I'm mid-50s and perhaps this is the time I start to feel old, lol. :)

With all the talk about the Trump memecoin, aren't these memecoins basically the same thing as other collectibles from the past?  Basically like the same thing as if Marvel Comics  releases a limited run of 500 versions of a comic book with a special variant cover?  Or chase cards in various forms of collectible cards (baseball, pokemon, etc.)?

Except a memecoin has a built in exchange and a way to sell it.  Like if I took a ""valuable"" comic book and tried to purchase goods or services with it, it would be hard because the other person doesn't know what it is worth.  And they worry there is information asymmetry that might cause them to overvalue the comic book.  Plus, they don't actually want to OWN the comic book and then have to sell it on eBay......which is a pain in the butt and (again) they are not a comic book merchant and might not price it correctly.

Isn't a Trump coin the same basic thing......except it is easy to check the value and easier to convert back into a currency you prefer (like bitcoin or US dollars)?  And with blockchain preventing counterfeiting (which can be a problem with other collectibles)?

Edit - Thanks a lot folks.  You basically confirmed what I suspected.  And - to be clear - I have no interest in buying memecoins.  I did buy comic books in my youth and do remember how valuable some of the old issues got......but that was true rarity.  It was from an era when comics were sold to children and mostly ended up rumpled up in a backpack.  Then the comic companies realized that ""collectors"" would buy more if they restarted Spider Man with a ALL NEW #1 issue and a bunch of limited edition variants of the #1 issues.....except now it wasn't children buying them.....it was adult men buying them and immediately sending them away to be ""graded"" and encased in lucite.  And then they would release ANOTHER ALL NEW #1 about 18 months later and the cycle would repeat and repeat......and you can guess how much those ""collectible"" comics are worth now.  You find them at comic shops in what's called the ""dollar box"" which is a box were any comic is a $1: It's junk.  I'm sure baseball cards are similar.  Heck, US postage stamps are similar: Postal service mostly prints stamps for collectors now.  I mean....stamps COULD be used on actual mail, but almost none are: Collectors buy them, bring them immediately home and put them in the collection......and they're only worth anything to another collector (who probably also bought them from the post office when they were new, lol).  Sounds like memecoins could be fun for some people, but they could also just gamble.  ",2

Especially as the price keeps rising a $3 soda is going to be .0000015 btc. Maybe I’m underestimating the learning curve if we started seeing it all over?

1hthmh2,"Bitcoin maxi posted ""Solana will be the first casualty of quantum"".  Solana responds with an option, though it still falls short of a quantum resistant solution. Solana posted news they have ""achieved quantum resistance internally"".  
  
Ultimately, this is an optional solution that users must set up.  Here is their description:  
  
 ""....based upon Winternitz One Time Signatures (W-OTS) - a hash-based, one-time signature scheme which builds upon Leslie Lamport's 1979 invention of Lamport Signatures. (No, the irony is not lost on me that we are using Lamport's work to secure lamports)  
  
While Lamport Signatures are too large to be validated in the constrained environment of a smart contract, W-OTS enables us to trade signature size for computational cost, making them just barely feasible to verify inside of a Solana smart contract""  


This just gives an ""option"" that could protect your stored coins -in the meantime- while they work on a solution that allows you to sign with a quantum resistant signature.

Satoshi era wallets should take the same action by moving to more secure wallets without an outgoing transactions. 

Ultimately, it looks to me like the crypto space will continue to try and confuse the issue and give folks a false sense of security.  Ehtereum has also posted about concepts, but has not landed on the solution they will choose to implement.  
  
There are probably 5-6 projects that talk about proper Quantum Resistance intelligently- in the same manner as NIST, government, and top tech companies do.    
  
While existing coins will remain busy figuring out long term solutions, I still prefer what QANX aims to bring to the space on top of the base requirement of proper quantum resistance.  But of course each has its own merit and strategy for marketshare..

In 2013 it was the first alts - new main chains with faster block times and new algorithms.

In 2017 it was more complicated alts with sharding, pos, smart contracts, ethereum icos, and contentious bitcoin forks like bitcoin cash.

In 2021 it was even more complicated alts, Defi, nfts, metaverse/vr, and elon buying dogecoin.

1h6r899," The Four Phases of the Bull Market Explained There are **four phases of a bull market**.

**Buckle up - we've just entered the most fun phase.**

# Stage 1: Rebirth

*January 2023 – January 2024*

In the Rebirth phase, bear market exhaustion is the prevailing feeling. Apathy kills all narratives. Your friends and the media still focus on bear market blowups. Layoffs keep happening.

However, prices quietly recover. BTC rallies 3x, but you barely notice you’re still underwater on everything. Only the deepest crypto natives who've seen 2+ cycles realize that the bull market has begun. Most people are still in disbelief that this is the bull market.

# Stage 2: Excitement

*February 2024 – Last week*

Some coins near all-time highs. Narratives come back, though there's only a few per quarter. Everyone in crypto understands that we are now in a bull market.

But it's odd your friends still aren't texting you. You're a weird combo of excited and anxious. Layoffs mostly end, but hiring hasn’t ramped up again. The space feels insular; no one leaves, no one comes in. Generally, life is good. Your crypto homies are winning.

This is the calm before the storm.

# Stage 3: Euphoria

*We're here now.*

Euphoria officially began on November 5th with the presidential election. This is a beautiful time. Everyone is making money, but the grifters haven’t rushed in yet. Take moments to really enjoy this time—it will be brief.

Everything you own is about to blow past ATHs (if it hasn’t already). There used to be a few new narratives every quarter; now there's a new narrative every week. By the end, it will become daily. There's no narrative exhaustion just ""good"" ideas.

Everyone with a following is a genius and has ideas on the new narrative. Someone will have made money on the coin of the week, and I can assure you they will post about it. This will be frustrating.

*(But remember, everyone has a bag to shill and no one posts their L’s.)*

With new narratives come new coins. Every day there will be a coin going up you won’t own most of them. You’ll be up 8% that week but seethe at the idea that you missed **\[big new coin\]**. New coins + new narratives = FOMO. If you’re not careful, FOMO will eat you alive.

**Some advice:**

* **Understand your approach and its tradeoffs.**
   * *Trading every day?* Know your job and mental health will suffer.
   * *Building?* Know you’ll miss some big trades.
* Everything has tradeoffs—understand them.
* Don’t try to do everything, or you will not make it.

**Back to Stage 3…**

The private market is about to get white-hot.

It starts with the allocators. They woke up on Nov 6th grossly underexposed to crypto. They’re calling the VCs and hedge funds to allocate. These firms will announce big new funds sooner than you realize.

Late-stage venture has been dead for 2+ years it comes roaring back. Big funds and an open IPO market mean Series B-D companies can raise again. Big raises become the norm. Series A deals fly off the table. This pulls in new, world-class founders.

Hiring starts to get very competitive. Protocols offer crazy token packages to top talent. If you’re a founder, you have 3–6 months max (probably less) to hire the best of the best at reasonable salaries. Then you’re chasing.

We're mainstream again. Forbes, Bloomberg, CNBC they love crypto. Your friend texts you about Cardano. Your financial advisor recommends a 5% BTC allocation. TradFi races to ""tokenize things.""

Then, at some point in mid-2025, weird things start to happen.

# Stage 4: Disconnection

Fortune 500s announce massive BTC purchases. Athletes and artists get involved crypto permeates culture. VCs throw due diligence out the window. Grifters raise millions and become main characters. Random coins 10x in a week.

In Stage 4, everyone starts to believe it’s going up forever. Delusion seeps into decisions. This stage could also be described as **Insanity**. Nothing makes sense anymore. There used to be new narratives weekly, now it’s all a blur.

You have more money than you ever thought you'd have. Your high school friend launches a token—he's worth tens of millions. An OG buys a sports team. Bieber launches a decentralized social platform. LeBron launches a memecoin. Companies spend billions on marketing.

So **buckle up**.

The next 12 months will be madness. For those who focus, 2025 can be life-changing. But if you're not careful, your arrogance and laziness in Stage 4 will be punishing.

Finally, make sure you take time to enjoy it every once in a while.

**Now, let's build.**",0

When I say best, I dont mean ""biggest gain"" I mean, best timing - I had an order to sell at $3500 USD on a sizable chunk of ETH that was filled in March 2024. We have not consistently been above that price again. Happy with the gain.

Worst? I converted 5 BTC to 100 ETH In 2022. That one swap cost me, today, at least $170k USD.

I have been hodling and staking SOL for 2 years. My original investment in SOL was less than $20k. It's now worth more than my entire ETH position and listen, a win is a win is a win, but... I'm kind of furious to see that as of today, right now, SOL is now a larger % of my portfolio than ETH. Psychologically, that's blowing my mind. I was never an ETH maxi, nor a SOL hater, but watching my number one coin (ETH) be overtaken by SOL in my own portfolio without any investment from me... is pissing me off.

1gjyy6z,"Traditional Investments v. Bitcoin The way I see it, the ordinary person is forced to throw money at the stock market due to currency debasement. Either invest or watch your cash be devalued. The ordinary person does not have the expertise or time to carefully curate their investments. Hence, we have modern portfolio theory and dollar cost averaging. We take a portion of our wages every month and put in a diversified portfolio set up by financial companies based on what they think is optimal for our situation and collect a fee for their trouble. I like that Bitcoin alleviates this paradigm and see it as one of its best value propositions to society. 

My question is, does traditional investing actually produce a ROI after fees, inflation, and taxes (even with tax advantaged accounts like 401ks and Roth IRAs)? I'm starting to feel like at best, I'm preserving the value I earned. Yes, you can outperform Bitcoin in the stock market. But not through MPT which is what most people, including myself, are doing. 

What are the merits of traditional investing (MPT) over Bitcoin? Do you think traditional investing is being undermined by Bitcoin's value proposition?

1ibotzm,"Coldcard vs Trezor Safe 5 (BTC) vs ? Hey guys, I'm a bit new to Bitcoin, but have done hundreds of hours of research and finally took the plunge a few weeks ago and put a good bit of my net worth in. I'm currently using Strike for DCA, and I'm very much enjoying it, but I think I'm ready to take a next step and get myself a signing device/hardware wallet. The main ones I'm looking at are the Coldcard and the Trezor Safe 5.

From what I understand, Coldcard is the ""safest"" because it's air gapped. I do really like this, but I've also heard it can be complicated to use, and as a major beginner I really want a simple solution that can introduce me to using different devices and methods. The Trezor looks very user friendly, whereas the Coldcard looks like a calculator.

My biggest concern is that my own lack of knowledge will cause me to lose money, not that someone will get ahold of my signing device or seed phrase. That being said, I'm leaning towards the Trezor, but a lot of my more diehard Bitcoiner friends are telling me the Coldcard is the only way.

Would really love some thoughts on which is better for a guy just starting out and looking to explore. Thanks!",2

1iedgxu,"To this day, Aave DAO has never sold a single ETH. While many DAOs and protocols sell ETH to pay for expenses, Aave DAO has never sold a single coin. Instead of selling their holdings, Aave does the opposite, they provide wETH liquidity on Aave and maintain a diversified treasury of Liquid Staking Tokens and Liquid Restaking Tokens. Their list of holdings includes Lido, RocketPool, Ether.fi, Stader, Kelp, and StakeWise. This way they ensure their reserves are deeply tied to Ethereum's growth. Aave DAO's ETH reserves are also growing weekly, adding about 100 ETH into their reserves regularly.

Not only does Aave hold ETH but it also runs validator nodes with Stader, and is getting ready to expand operations with Lido, EtherFi, and Rocket Pool. They're supporting Ethereum from the very core of the network.

But if they never sell ETH, how do they pay for expenses? The answer is actually very simple, they are very profitable. Instead of selling ETH, they use stablecoins from their reserves to cover the costs. Also, recently they made some bold decisions to cut costs and let go of excessive staff to optimize spending.

This is financial discipline and people notice it. Some users tagged Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation on twitter, saying Aave's strategy is the perfect way to manage a treasury. Someone argued if the Ethereum Foundation adopted the same practices, ETH would be $10,000 by now.

In my opinion if it were up to Aave, Ethereum would win.

1i570ws,"Memecoin season is the new altcoin season I'm on the verge of fully believing memecoins are the new altcoins. The only altcoin that really surpassed its ATH so far is Solana. Memecoins have been going volatile for months already. Fartcoin gained 40% within a day! And with Trump coin releasing, I think it may only be a matter of days before meme(alt)coin season is over and we're back to bear market. 

I don't wish for this, but considering Trump coin's popularity, it being a meme in essence, and a bunch of newbies rolling in to buy it, makes me think once it inevitably crashes, people will be yelling ""cRyPTO iS a ScAm!!!"". ",2

1ifimym,"Tarrifs resulting in BTC bump? So, I'm pretty sure Monday's tarrifs are just the beginning of a major stock market reset (at best) and, after 20yrs of savings, on Friday I liquidated almost all my stock.  I called a couple people I generally invest with to tell them I wasn't going to be coming to meetings for the foreseeable future and was surprised to hear that they'd both done the same.  

All of us were basically discussing where to invest now.  We can't be alone here. I'm thinking a bunch of that money leaving the stock market is going to be put into BTC.

That's question one.

Next: I used to work for an export company that worked with eastern Europe and Russia.  When tarrifs were imposed (on their side) we'd use outside bank transfers to bypass them.  (I was a young intern working computers and thought this was totally legit).  Anyway, now we are the one imposing tarrifs and people are going to be doing lots of work-arounds.  Crypto is, by far, the easiest method to set up internationally.

So, the combination of people getting out of the market because they think it will collapse, plus people using crypto to bypass tarrifs....  Will that increase BTC?  Or am I just trying to convince myself it's a good idea?",0

Bro, btc is at $80,000. That's $80K. Said out loud it's Eighty Thousand Dollars.  
To spell it out - E-I-G-H-T-Y T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D.

Get a grip, stop panicking. If you invested more than you could afford to lose, you were already fucked. Bitcoin has always been volatile. Right now it's around a 30% drop from the ATH lol, spaghettifingers panicking and fudding others like it's -99% and btc is under $100 lol.

In times like these you are only panicking, if you do not understand bitcoin. So if you are panicking, read the whitepaper. In case you never seen it, it's here - [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

If you are shaking and crying, read it, understand it, and read it again. You should have done it before you bought any crypto.

BTC always drops during the bull run to shake out the weak worms. Stop listening to FUD, stop listening to youtubers and other influencers who have no idea what they're talking about, only engagement farming off the FUD.

Times like these when all the nobbies are panicking is usually the best time to stack up and insert more capital. Unless you got liquidated lol, then you are fucked.",0
1i7wzsv,"Advice on btc and altcoins I don't know if its too late but, I recently got some money and wanted to invest in a few coins. I know bitcoin is doing really well right now but I seen a few altcoins that were also doing good like XRP.

What makes altcoins go up in price? Is it their utility? What are some coins that could still go up? Is Hbar good? XLM? CLV?  
Could Bitcoin go stay at around 105k? I was thinking of buying at a dip below 100k.  
I seen that solana is doing good right now too? It is a good idea to buy on a dip?

I just want general feedback about altcoins. How can I do research on these coins, what should I look for?",1

1i0ktr1,"I Found A Forgotten Announcement of BITCOIN V0.1 By Satoshi, 16 Years Ago 16 years ago, SATOSHI posted this message to sourceforge - Announcing Bitcoin V0.1 - This sourceforge announcement is almost identical to the Cryptography Mailing List announcement, posted on January 8th 2009. 

There are a few grammatical differences and a different download link for the Bitcoin program, but other than that, the message is the same. 
21 million coins and no more. 

The fun thing about this sourceforge announcement is that it appears to have been forgotten. The record for it is not accounted for by The Nakamoto Institute, The Book of Satoshi, or even Kicking The Hornets Nest

Perhaps it should be added to the Satoshi history books. Makes you wonder what other forgotten digital artifacts are out there.

1i42hk7,"Do you think Doge will rise during or after the inauguration? With Elon Musk stepping more into the political spotlight lately, I can’t help but wonder if this could have an impact on Dogecoin, especially as we get closer to or just after the next inauguration.

We’ve seen how much sway Elon has over the crypto market, particularly Doge. A single tweet or even a vague reference from him can send it soaring. Now that he seems to be more involved in political conversations and making moves that might increase his influence, could this trickle down to Dogecoin’s favor?

It’s also worth considering how his broader goals, like integrating crypto into X, might play a role. If his political involvement strengthens the platforms he owns, we could see Doge positioned as more than just a meme coin. It’s a long shot, but stranger things have happened in the crypto world.

What’s your take? ",1
